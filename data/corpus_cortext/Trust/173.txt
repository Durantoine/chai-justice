framework responsible limits facial recognition use case flow managementintroduction past decade facial recognition emerged one powerful biometric technologies capable identifying verifying person comparing analysing patterns based individual facial contours improvements facial recognition systems due mainly progress machine learning sensors expected boost market technology billion compared billion indeed efficient facial recognition systems achieved respectable accuracy score easily exceed facial recognition technology many applications improving consumer experiences banking retail sectors speeding border control airports development technology creates considerable opportunities socially beneficial uses also poses serious threat human rights civil liberties notably freedom

american civil liberties union aclu recent years public concerns facial recognition technology grown fuelled various controversies retailers used technology without notice increasing number schools deploying monitor data breaches biometrics regularly personal data used develop facial recognition systems without asking users although progress facial recognition technology considerable past years ethical concerns surfaced regarding limitations studies facial recognition unfairly biased performing differently based demographic characteristics recent study found system accuracy performance affected skin tone could lead misidentification individuals furthermore gender age height eyewear headscarf also affect accuracy performance depending system used law enforcement scenarios could
