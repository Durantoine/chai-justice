74) As regards big data applications in the healthcare sector, four sets of
problems stand out as especially relevant to questions of justice: first,
access to datasets for the research sector; second, the insidious con-
solidation of monopolistic structures; third, the inclusion of health
apps, as well as various devices that facilitate private self-tracking, in
determining health insurance premiums; and fourth, aspects of social
justice, understood in terms of the capabilities approach, as they con-
cern the responsible handling of health-relevant data.

Professor at the University of Oxford, thought that “soft regulation would be
irresponsible” because the criminal justice system is “one of the most high-
risk areas [she] can think of”.107 Dr Joe Purshouse and his co-contributors
reflected that while guidance documents may be cited in court, they “do not
provide actionable grounds for an individual to make a complaint”, adding
that “non-compliance would not impact on the admissibility of any material
gleaned.”108
