    15308/18    PL/mk  2   LIFE 1.C   EN    ANNEX   Gender Equality, Youth and Digitalisation1  NOTING THAT:   1. Driven by technological innovations such as the internet, information and communication  technology (ICT), artificial intelligence (AI), automation, robotics and Industry 4.0,  digitalisation is comprehensively transforming lives, communities and even identities.  This process is not gender neutral and  can only be understood if it is seen in the broader  context of ongoing societal change, including the evolving roles of women and men and  advancing gender equality. Digitalisation brings with it many new opportunities in all spheres  of life. Yet, it can also help to perpetuate existing inequalities and stereotypes and pose new  risks for youth, especially young women and girls.   2. The benefits of digit alisation for children and young people have so far not received sufficient  attention from policy -makers and public debate on the subject still tends to focus mainly on  the risks and drawbacks. However, a positive approach to digitalisation is also needed with a  view to ensuring that children and  young people can more fully enjoy its advantages and  benefit from the opportunities it offers. In particular, digitalisation has great potential for the  empowerment of young  women and girls, for example through new  forms of civic and  political participation via social media and online cooperation and consultation. Online  networks and initiatives can also improve the functioning of democracy and strengthen the  role of civil society. Meanwhile, the risks and drawbacks  also continue to require attention — for example, new forms of online violence , the circulation of harmful digital material , and  gender stereotypes linked to sexuality and body image, which are intertwined with offline  risks and inequalities  for all young p eople .                                                    1 This document has been drawn up within the framework of the review of the implementation  of the Beijing Platform for Action, with particular reference to t he critical area of concern  "L: The Girl Child."  
    15308/18    PL/mk  3   LIFE 1.C   EN    3. While many young people are "digital natives" with intuitive digital competences and are thus  used to navigating online space, guidance and support is needed in order to ensure that they  have equal access to the various benefits of digitalisatio n. The active use of an online space  free of gender stereotypes, especially by young women and girls, needs to be further fostered  and promoted.   4. In the Trio Presidency Declaration on Equality between Women and Men that they signed in  2017, Estonia, Bul garia and Austria undertook to bring gender equality back onto the EU's list  of priorities, to strengthen gender mainstreaming in all policy areas and to address the impact  of digitalisation on gender equality. As the Estonian and Bulgarian Presidencies ha ve already  addressed issues such as education, skills and the future of work, the Austrian Presidency  decided to focus on the opportunities arising from digitalisation in areas such as civic and  political participation .   5. When addressing the subject of gender equality, youth and digitalisation, policy -makers  should listen to young people themselves, as they are key experts on their current and future  lives. In preparing this document , the Austrian Presidency therefore consu lted organisations  such as the European Youth Forum and the Austrian National Youth Council.   6. Gender equality and youth -inclusion policies should be better integrated and made more  future -oriented. The EU Conference entitled "Gender Equality and YOU. Yo ung Voices. Joint  Initiative." organised by the Austrian Presidency in October 2018 demonstrated that active  cooperation between relevant stakeholders in the areas of gender equality and youth inclusion  helps to build effective networks for promoting gende r equality. The European Youth Goals  developed jointly  by young people and decision -makers  in the course of the 6th cycle of the  Structured Dialogue through a participatory process  are an example of successfully  mainstreaming gender equality in youth polic ies and adopting an intersectional approach.  
    15308/18    PL/mk  4   LIFE 1.C   EN    7. NGOs and civil society have a key role to play in shaping the future of gender equality. They  should be actively involved in policy -making as their expertise is key to developing and  effectively implementing  sound gender equality policies.   8. In order to ensure further progress in this field, there is a need for regular and institutionalised  dialogue about gender equality at the EU level as well as a need for strategic instruments, for  stronger input into the political process by gender experts and for visibility at a high political  level. The Joint Declaration entitled “Gender Equality as a P riority of the European Union  today and in the future,” recently signed by a large majority of EU  Member States, calls for a  strong network and continuous dialogue between all relevant actors in the area of gender  equality and for systematic and effective cooperation between the Member States and the  European Union  institutions. In this document, the signatories also voiced their commitment  to actively facilitate regular exchanges between relevant actors.   9. This document has been drawn up in the context of  the review of the implementation by the  Member States and EU institutions of the Beijing Platform for Action,2 with particular  reference to the critical area of concern "L: The Girl Child." Policies related to gender  equality and digitalisation are also v ital for the pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs) set in the context of the United Nations' Agenda 2030, which takes a dual approach,  combining gender mainstreaming with a specific goal on gender equality (SDG 5).3   10. This document  builds on previous work and political commitments voiced by the Council, the  European Parliament, the Commission and other relevant stakeholders in this area, including  the documents listed in Annex II.                                                     2  The United Nations' agenda for gender equality and women's empowerment.   3  SDG5:  "Achiev e gender equality and empower all women and girls.

    15308/18    PL/mk  5   LIFE 1.C   EN    11. WE WELCOME  the report on the Review of the impl ementation of the Beijing Platform for  Action in the EU Member States entitled "Gender equality and youth: opportunities and risks  of digitalisation"4 prepared by the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) at the  request of the Austrian Presidency o f the Council of the EU. This report provides an analysis  of the opportunities and risks of digitalisation for girls and boys, with particular focus on civic  and political participation online as well as on new forms of online violence. It offers  quantitat ive analysis, as well as insights based on the voices and expertise of young  Europeans themselves. WE WELCOME  the four new indicators5 proposed by EIGE which  focus on  digital skills, self -confidence in using digital technologies, the use of the internet fo r  civic or political participation  and cyberbullying .6  12. In the light of EIGE's report, WE NOTE THAT , while the majority of young women and  men believe they have sufficient digital skills, young women tend to indicate somewhat lower  confidence in their digital skills. Thus gender stereotypes can affect young people’s lives and  occupational choices and le ad to gender segregation at school and later in the labour market.  Addressing gender stereotypes in relation to the use of digital technologies, and continued  investment in young people’s transversal and digital skills and competences, particularly  among y outh from disadvantaged backgrounds and young people in vulnerable situations, is  needed. Social media and online news can enable young people to be more active in terms of  citizenship and public life; measures to enhance critical and innovative thinking, creativity  and media literacy are needed to support this process. Young women engage with social  media even more actively than their male peers, yet they participate less actively in online  debates and restrict their expression for fear of exposure to abus e and due to continued  discriminatory standards concerning public participation. When it comes to digital  communication of a sexual nature, young women also face a higher risk of harassment as  compared with young men. Gender -sensitive approaches to digital  media literacy, legislation  and policy are the best way of tackling these risks.                                                     4 Doc. 14348 /18 ADD 2.
