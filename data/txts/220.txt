What is digital education?Digital education refers to the use of digital tools, technologies and content to support teaching, learning and assessment. It includes everything from online courses and interactive learning platforms to virtual classrooms and educational apps.Digital education helps learners of all ages build the digital skills they need to thrive in today’s connected world. It also empowers teachers and trainers with innovative methods to personalise learning and reach more students.By making education more flexible, inclusive and accessible, digital education plays a key role in creating a modern and resilient education system across the European Union (EU).What is the Digital Education Action Plan?The Digital Education Action Plan (2021-2027) is a policy initiative that sets out a common vision of high-quality, inclusive and accessible digital education in Europe. It aims to help national education and training systems adapt to the digital age.The plan was adopted in 2020, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. It calls for greater cooperation at EU level to address the challenges and opportunities arising from the accelerating digital transformation. It also seeks to enhance support for teachers, students, policy makers, academia and researchers at national, EU and international level.Why is action needed?The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift towards online and hybrid learning, which still continues to evolve, revealing innovative ways for students and educators to engage in more personal and flexible learning.At the same time, it enhanced challenges and inequalities:Many learners lack access to digital technologies, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds.Education and training institutions face limitations in digital infrastructure and capacity.Teachers need more training in using digital tools effectively.Overall digital skills levels remain low across the EU.Some key figures:Fewer than 40% of educators across the EU felt ready to use digital technologies in teaching (OECD, 2018)Over 40% of 13-14-year-olds in the EU lack basic digital skills, falling short of the EU's 2030 goal of reducing this figure below 15%(ICILS, 2023).20% of low-income households lack access to computers and broadband (Eurostat, 2020)95% of respondents in the public consultation for this action plan said the COVID-19 pandemic marked a turning point in educational technology use (Digital Education Action Plan public consultation, 2020)












Policy context The Action Plan is a crucial component in establishing the European Education Area. Its proposal was informed by a 2020 open public consultation that gathered views and experiences of citizens, institutions and organisations.The initiative contributes to several European Commission priorities, including:A Europe fit for the Digital AgeNext Generation EURecovery and Resilience FacilityUnion of SkillsEuropean Skills AgendaEuropean Social Pillar Action Plan2030 Digital Compass: the European way for the Digital DecadeAs a key deliverable of the Union of Skills, a 2030 Roadmap on the future of digital education and skills will build on a review of the Action Plan. This roadmap will complement other strategic initiative like the Action Plan on Basic Skills and the STEM Education Strategic Plan, and will aim to establish a robust and inclusive EU digital education ecosystem.Building on previous workThe Digital Education Action Plan (2021-2027) builds on the first Digital Education Action Plan (2018-2020).
