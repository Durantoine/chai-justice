    Our principles and pillars




    


    


            
            


  
  
      The Principles for Trust and Transparency are the guiding values that distinguish the IBM approach to responsible AI.
  




    


            
        




Read the Principles for Trust and Transparency











        



  
    The purpose of AI is to augment human intelligence






    


    



IBM believes AI should make all of us better at our jobs, and that the benefits of the AI era should touch the many, not just the elite few.








        



  
    Data and insights belong to their creator






    


    



IBM clients’ data is their data, and their insights are their insights. We believe that government data policies should be fair and equitable and prioritize openness.






        



  
    Technology must be transparent and explainable






    


    



Companies must be clear about who trains their AI systems, what data was used in training and, most importantly, what went into the recommendations of their algorithms.












            
            


  
  
      The Principles are supported by the Pillars of Trust, our foundational properties for responsible AI.

 
  




    


            
        



























































        



  
    Explainability






    


    



Good design does not sacrifice transparency in creating a seamless experience.





























































        



  
    Fairness






    


    



Properly calibrated, AI can assist humans in making choices more fairly.





























































        



  
    Robustness






    


    



As systems are employed to make crucial decisions, AI must be secure and robust.






























































        



  
    Transparency






    


    



Transparency reinforces trust, and the best way to promote transparency is through disclosure.






























































        



  
    Privacy






    


    



AI systems must prioritize and safeguard consumers’ privacy and data rights.
