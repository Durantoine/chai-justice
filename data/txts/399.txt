Overview


New technology comes with unknown obstacles and unintended risks requiring accountable design and lifecycle planning to ensure responsible innovation. As artificial intelligence, autonomous intelligent systems (AIS), machine learning, autonomous vehicles, and robotics advance at a rapid pace, careful considerations need to be made during development and implementation regarding humanity. At IEEE SA, our global community has developed resources and standards globally recognized in the area of applied ethics and systems engineering and continues to develop accessible and sustainable approaches and solutions for pragmatic application of AIS principles and frameworks. IEEE SA offers standards, training and education, certification programs, and more, to empower stakeholders designing, developing, and using AIS. Global participation is encouraged to offer the broadest regional and cultural perspectives required to best contextualize how AIS systems can avoid risk and offer greatest benefit in operation.
