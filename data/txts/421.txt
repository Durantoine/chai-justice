4 Preface Technologies can rarely be reduced to their mere commercial added value.   The history of the Industrial Revolution teaches us that nation states have always  endeavored to build or maintain political supremacy through pioneering economic  achievements. In the age of digital upheavals, multiple disruptions and immense  acceleration, this dictum still applies. The topic of “artificial intelligence” plays a special role here – a technology that is  currently being discussed worldwide and increasingly applied. As with any new tech nology, both the Cassandrian pessimists (such as Steven Hawking or Elon Musk) and  the progress optimists (Mark Zuckerberg, Eric Schmidt or Bill Gates) contribute their  theses on the future development of humanity. They widely vary from dark dystopia  to paradisiacal future prospects. Let us hope that the recently appointed Enquete Commission of the German Bundestag will counter an agitated and possibly overheated debate with sober stocktaking.  Germany’s AI strategy, which is expected by the end of the year, must define quanti fiable goals and concrete measures, which will then be vigorously implemented. The  political crash barriers necessary for the use of automated machine learning need to  be established. Other countries are well ahead in this respect. They have long since defined AI strate gies, developed business models and subjected ground-breaking applications to initial  practical tests. Therefore, it is worth taking a close look at how other economies are  dealing with the digital revolution: What regulatory framework conditions have they  defined? How do they implement policy strategies and programs to create new indus trial policy facts? With this two-part publication, the Konrad Adenauer Foundation intends to give a com parative overview of the AI strategies of major national economies in order to provide  food for thought and inspire the German debate. We believe: “Tech is politics” – and pol itics and civil society should give this more attention and discuss this more vigorously. I hope you find this publication an inspiring read. Yours  Dr. Gerhard Wahlers Dr. Gerhard Wahlers is Deputy Secretary General and Head of the Principal Department   for European and International Cooperation of the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung.
5Background and Definitions Artificial intelligence:   rapid developments and designs of the  initial conceptual AI frameworks. In July 2018, the German government published a  key issues paper for the German Artificial Intelli gence (AI) strategy, in which they acknowledged:  “Artificial intelligence has reached a new stage of  maturity in recent years and is becoming a driver  of digitization and autonomous systems in all  spheres of life.”1 The document urged the state,  society, the economy, the government, and sci ence to consider artificial intelligence in depth  and deal with its opportunities and risks. A comprehensive German AI strategy will now  be developed by the end of November and its  results presented at the Digital Summit in early  December. The aim is to prominently embed the  topic of AI in the digital policy of the Federal Gov ernment. In this way, Germany is catching up with  a large number of countries that in recent years  produced extensive initiatives for AI strategy and  processes.2 These strategies are motivated by remarkable  progress in the research and application of AI sys tems, many based on Machine Learning (ML) tech niques – particularly Deep Learning (DL) and the  variety of neural network designs that DL experts  have created. The global relevance of AI technologies is demonstrated by their prominent representation on this  year’s international agenda – from the Munich  Security Conference in February, to the presen tation of the EU Commission’s3 AI paper in April,  and to the joint AI declaration in June from the G7  countries in Canada (“Charlevoix Common Vision  for the Future of Artificial Intelligence”).4  The role of Artificial Intelligence as a potential  key technology of dystopian future concepts,  social control, and autocratic world power fan -tasies is also finding its way further into public  debate. This overview, however, focuses on the  analysis of AI frameworks in six countries and  how they deal with the revolutionary potential of  Artificial Intelligence. How this report defines   Artificial Intelligence: „In the broadest sense, artificial intelligence  is the ability of machines to learn, to think, to  plan and to perceive (i.  e., the qualities that  we primarily identify with human cognition).  This ability is achieved by digital technologies  or hybrid digital-physical technologies, which  imitate the cognitive and physical functions  of humans. For that purpose, AI systems do  not only process data, they recognize pat terns, draw conclusions, and become more  intelligent over time. Their ability to adopt and  refine newly developed skills has improved  significantly since the turn of the century.  This also means that what is referred to as AI  changes with each major technological break through, and the definition must therefore be  periodically adjusted.“ 1 Cf.

6Summary The race for world leadership in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies has begun. Since the publica tion of the Obama government’s AI strategy in 2016, other countries have looked for ways to promote  research and development (R&D), to encourage commercialization of AI and to catch up with the lead ing AI nation, the USA. The following summary describes the findings from the analyses of the first six  countries (USA, China, Great Britain, France, Finland and South Korea). These six countries comprise  Part One of a 12-country study for the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. Some of the key findings include: Vague and inconsistent AI definitions:  In the  strategies compared, there are very different defi nitions of AI – and in some cases no definitions  at all. The only thing they have in common is an  understanding of AI as a driving force in the digi tal revolution, which involves both potential and  risk in terms of social, economic and, to some  extent, security policy. Accordingly, they often  leave aside any existing sector or digital strate gies. An AI strategy should therefore be preceded  by a definition of AI concepts, and it should not  be too specialized – instead conceived of and  anchored in a cross-sector approach. Lack of target systems: The strategies are pre dominantly formulated in general terms. Their  partially vague objectives relate to different levels  of impact, which will make it more difficult to con trol their implementation and measure their suc cess. China, for example, measures the economic  strength of the AI industry, among other metrics,  while the UK sets targets for the number of future  doctoral candidates. A future AI strategy should  be based on a system of measurable targets that  take into account the complexity of a holistic Ger man approach. This is necessary to understand  whether the strategy leads to the desired effects.  At the same time, it needs a mechanism that  allows for the observation of global AI trends and  the measures used by other countries, especially  as these effects are still unfolding. In this way, the  German strategy could be adapted and globally  integrated. AI superpowers vs. “fortress countries”:  In the US  and China, the leading AI countries, the dynamics  of AI development are largely determined by the private sector, particularly young companies and  Internet companies with global operations. While  the trend in the United States is towards further  deregulation, China is seeing tendencies towards  increased state control of the large technology  companies. Neither of these currents will slow  down the worldwide distribution of their AI prod ucts. In the countries of continental Europe, which  are focused more on science and the protection  of the individual, there is a lack of such global  players. This is partly due to a very high degree  of skepticism towards digital technologies and a  resulting protective stance in policy-making. Their  support is aimed at the development of research  networks, open data pools and technology trans fer to the established manufacturing industry and  SMEs, but not at creating a global, formative voice.  In contrast to the USA, where the permeability  between business and science has grown over the  past ten years, the success of European attempts  to achieve this permeability is very limited, let  alone attempts to scale it. Therefore, to have a  constructive voice on the world stage, a strategy  must point out ways to trigger a more-effective  exchange between the separate fortresses of sci ence and business and then project that economic  power globally. AI in production 4.0 vs Digital Society 5.0: In  East Asia, the Fourth Industrial Revolution (South  Korea) and Society 5.0 (Japan) are considered the  inevitable next stages in human development,  in which AI will influence all spheres of life. This  results from a constellation of specific economic  growth targets and demographic limitations and  is facilitated by a focus on research, commer cialization and rapid scale-up of AI applications. 
7Summary In contrast to that, Europe risks focusing too  closely on manufacturing aspects, despite further  specializing in basic research and the concept of  industry 4.0. To understand the upcoming cogni tive age and actively shape it, a digitally strong,  qualified and young population is needed as a  “home base.” For this to succeed in Europe, the  mainstream society must open itself toward the  potential of this technology, both critically and  constructively – but quickly, above all. Ethics and human orientation as strategic  strengths of the Europeans: Although ethical  issues are discussed in different social forums  in China and the USA, the topic is not given any  high priority by the respective governments. This  creates the space for Europe to take the lead on  the issue of ethical AI, as has been attempted by  French President Macron. While Britain has taken  the initiative in developing an international AI gov ernance architecture faster than France, the Brexit  movement has weakened the country’s ability  to project these developments. One of Europe’s  challenges stems from the fragmentation of their  internal data market, which potentially could  comprise 500 million inhabitants. In addition,  the calls for ethical design of AI have hardly been  accompanied by concrete suggestions or strate gies. To help shape future innovation of cognitive  machines for both the European digital market  and for other economic regions, it will be nec essary to think outside the box and beyond the  basic data-protection regulations. The European  and German ethics and their sense of responsibil ity can be conveyed more easily through digital  economic power. Lack of computing capacities as a strategic  weakness: While the availability of data and train ing of specialists are promoted by many strategies  as a prerequisite for AI research and commerciali zation, only in a few cases is there also a focus on  the expansion of domestic computing capacities  (the exceptions are South Korea and China). The  current global trade conflicts show that availability  of powerful chips or access to cloud-based com puting power is a strategic necessity. Compared to  the US and East Asia, the European countries are  not competitive in this field.Ecosystems as a strategic asset: To develop  higher quality AI solutions and implement them  into the international dialogue, Europe will need  experienced investors and an agile legislature in  addition to its researchers, talented developers  and strategic entrepreneurs. While these parties  provide the fertile ground for successful com mercialization of AI in the USA and China, Great  Britain is the only European country beginning  to succeed in this respect. In France or Germany,  the small number of AI startups bears witness to  the fact that such ecosystems are not yet thought  through and supported to the extent necessary.  A strategy must create incentives for the parties  involved to be willing to locate in Germany and  establish platforms for their exchange. The countries at a glance: USA:  The most influential publications on AI, an  estimated 3,000-plus doctoral students in the  field each year, about 1,400 AI startups, seven  of the world’s ten largest technology companies,  and the cooperation between universities, public  authorities and companies that has grown over  the last 40 years – this combination of factors is  the reason the U.  S. holds global leadership in AI.  In view of the increasing competition, especially  from China, and the strategic relevance for the  economy and society, the Obama administration  has also presented the world’s first national AI  strategy. The Trump government has yet to produce a  national strategy, as called for by US Secretary  of Defense Mattis. In addition to funds from the  private sector, basic research receives funding  through a key part of the government’s annual AI  R&D budget (1.3 billion Euro). In addition, fund ing from individual departments also supports AI  development, with the Department of Defense  alone spending 6.3 billion Euro (2017). What is  more, Washington supports the commercializa tion of AI by reducing and removing regulatory  barriers. However, it remains to be seen, whether  the America First immigration policy inhibits the  country’s ability to attract AI experts from around  the world. And it remains to be seen how differ -
8Summary ent initiatives from the executive and legislative  branches will form and shape new AI strategy. China: The country has set out a three-step plan  to become the world’s leading AI nation by 2030,  and it is the only country to set measurable mac roeconomic targets for this purpose. More than  700 million Chinese internet users and growing  groups of high-performance hardware and tech nology companies – which have become serious  competitors to American firms because of the  protected domestic market – combine to create  the optimal conditions for this strategy. Although  the country still lags the US in basic research,  training of qualified specialists, the number of AI  startups and internationally enforced patents;  the developments in recent years leave no doubt  that China is catching up. Beijing has announced  spending of 16.4 billion Euro to promote the mico chip industry alone, and at the sub-national level  a single city (Tijian) has set up a fund of 12.8 bil lion euros for AI promotion. With the Thousand  Talents scheme, Beijing wants to bring back highly  qualified Chinese expatriates. However, despite  the massive deployment of resources, scientific  breakthrough cannot be planned, particularly not  in the weak field of basic research. In addition to  financial resources, favorable academic frame works are require, and developing of them takes  time. What is more, export of AI products devel oped under Chinese data protection standards  is encumbered by strict regulations in Western  countries. Great Britain: At the beginning of 2018, the Brit ish government and the private economic sector  agreed to jointly promote R&D and the commer cialization of AI with 1 billion Euro. The agree ment is based on the country’s strengths: British  AI research is very influential internationally, and  nowhere else in Europe are there more AI start ups concentrated in one place than in London. At  the same time, the government has set the foun dation for the development of ethical guidelines  for AI, including the establishment of a Centre for  Ethics and an international AI Ethics Conference  planned for 2019. However, the commercializa tion of research, as expressed by the small num ber of patent publications, among other factors, is considered a “historic weakness.” It is still unclear  how the country will continue to attract scien tists and entrepreneurs after Brexit, and how it  will compensate for its loss of influence in the EU.  What is clear, however, is that the UK is currently  expanding their technological cooperation with  the US. After Brexit, other European countries will  have to do without the Anglo-Saxon approach. France:  Macron has formulated a leadership claim  by striking the balance between the Chinese and  American strategies, and basing it on European  values. The French president reckons his coun try’s greatest advantage in AI development to be  in the centralized structure and organization of  the political system. In the areas of health, mobil ity and defense, the relevant ministries are using  strategies and resources to stimulate AI applica tions. However, it is questionable whether innova tions can be centrally controlled in the long run,  because success in AI requires a broad spectrum  of experiments in various fields of application.  A striking trend is the small number of French  institutes and teaching staff that actively conduct  research in areas directly related to AI (Great Brit ain has almost eight times more, Germany about  four times more), as well as the lack of coopera tion between academia and industry. Planned  centers of excellence will help bring together  scientists to work with users in projects and sce narios that are, to a certain extent, autonomous.  And, at the same time, new rules established  by Macron will allow researchers to work con currently in the academic and private sectors.  About 30 public institutions have set up branches  around the Startup Campus “Station F” in Paris to  advise startup companies on legal issues while  learning what new AI developments might mean  for the country. A network of voluntary AI experts  (“AI reserve”) is to advise the state on the procure ment of technologies and support cyber security. Finland: In Helsinki, it is clear that the big strings  in AI development are pulled elsewhere. The  country’s data pool and market cannot keep pace  with the big AI players. Thus, the focus is entirely  on AI application and cooperation between busi ness, science and administration – by topic across  separate domestic and European ecosystems. The 
9Summary major part of the funds made available for the  field are aimed at the promotion of a small but  growing AI startup scene and the adaptation of  traditional industries to AI through research subsi dies. One interesting feature is “Innovation vouch ers,” which enable companies to purchase exper tise from other firms or researchers and use it to  develop and test new ideas. Commercial potential  for AI beyond Finland’s borders is available in the  health sector, based on the Finnish genome pro ject “FinnGen” and in cooperation with IBM Wat son Health. Another niche is the development of  a protocol for international data exchange (IHAN),  similar to the IBAN protocol for bank transfers.  Among the countries examined, Finland is the  only one to submit its own government document  that’s specifically dedicated to work and ethics in  the AI age. And it intends to keep those regula tions adaptable, so it can adjust to all the potential  opportunities for making AI usable. South Korea:  In Seoul, AI technologies are consid ered to be part of an inevitable “fourth industrial  revolution,” similar to German industry 4.0. Based  on the economic model of export-oriented indus trial production, which has been very successful  to date, the focus is on the promotion of strategic  hardware and AI applications. The Moon govern ment has good preconditions on which it can  build toward competing with the larger AI play ers. South Korea is already in third place in filing  the most AI patents, behind the USA and China.  Around 1 billion Euro have been made available to  be spent on brain research, the findings of which  are expected to lead to the next breakthrough  in the field of neural networks. To enable faster  commercialization of AI applications, “transitional  licenses” are intended to allow companies to  develop their products to market maturity while  government approval procedures are still in pro gress. This could take place, for example, in the  large-scale, networked tech parks (e.  g. “Innopo lis”), where AI research is being conducted right  next to industrial sites. The data and knowledge  obtained there will then be shared with startups  and SMEs to help them develop new services and  technologies. To promote early commercialization  of knowledge closely in line with research, more  than 80 universities grant their students absence periods of up to four semesters to take care of  their startups. The best among them are deter mined through national events that prepare them  for international competition and help them build  an international profile. So far, there are hardly  any AI startups, and large corporations such as  Samsung prefer to buy innovation abroad.

11 ›World leader in AI due to established cooperation structures between government,   the private sector and universities: The state’s funding is focused on basic research,   while the private sector concentrates on application research.  ›Public funding schemes focus their efforts on the contextual adaptability of AI   (what is referred to as the “third wave”)  ›Ethics has no great significance under TrumpUnited States of America    Defending the global   AI leadership position I.) Introduction  In 2016, the National Science and Technology  Council  (NSTC), on behalf of the Obama govern ment, developed the USA’s first AI strategy, which  is considered a blueprint for other countries, e.  g.  China.6 In addition to assessment of the interde pendencies and implications of AI, automation,  and economics7 the “National Strategy Plan for  AI Research and Development” postulates the  defense of the country’s AI leadership position as  well as the courageous vision of “a future world  where AI is safely deployed for all members of  society.”8The fact that the AI is considered a priority of the  Trump government “since the first day” is empha sized by the current Deputy Chief Technology  Officer  Michael Kratsios.9 In contrast to that, Tim  Hwang, former Google employee (global pub lic policy for AI and Machine Learning), gave a  reminder at the beginning of 2018, saying “we  are still waiting for the White House to provide a  strategic direction.”10 General tendencies of this  unfolding development have been noticeable  since May 2018: the focus is on strengthening  the environment for research and development  (R&D); supporting American workers; reducing  “innovation inhibitors;” and enabling industry- 0,00,20,40,60,81,01,2 Finland Republic  of KoreaGermany United States of AmericaUnited  KingdomFrance China General requirements Research and Development  Cambrian AI Index Commercialisation0,00,20,40,60,81,01,2 Finland Republic  of KoreaGermany United States of AmericaUnited  KingdomFrance China General requirements Research and Development  Cambrian AI Index Commercialisation 
12United States of America The US private sector has traditionally played a  central role in the research, development and  commercialization of new technologies. This is  underlined by milestones such as: 1) Kinect (Xbox  360 games console from Microsoft 2010), which  is the first to translate body movements into the  virtual world of gaming with the help of a 3D  camera and infrared sensor; 2) the IBM-AI Wat son, which won the panel game Jeopardy against  professional players in 2010; and 3) the victory of  Google‘s AI AlphaGO over Go grand master Lee  Sedol. Against the background of this private eco nomic dynamic, the government‘s role is limited,  with the White House merely acting as a coordi nator.21 Kratsios, Chief Technology Officer  at the  White House, says that „the frontline of AI policy  lies with federal agencies.”22 The most important  authorities with regard to AI promotion are: the  Department of Commerce, the Energy Depart ment, the Department of Defense (including the  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or  DARPA), the National Science Foundation  (NSF),  and the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects  Activity (IARPA), a research organization to sup port the intelligence services. Leaders from are  to be given a seat on an AI committee, which was  announced at the May 2018 AI Summit to improve  coordination and advise the White House.23 The  legislative branch deals with AI in a largely inde pendent fashion from the executive powers. At  the end of 2017, the Representative John Dela ney in his Future of A.  I. Act  called for  the establish ment of an „Advisory Council for the Development  and Implementation of AI“ at the federal level to  advise the Commerce Department and Congress  and to deal with AI-related issues, including the  USA’s competitiveness, implications for the labor  market, ethical aspects and international coop eration.24 The law had yet to be passed as of July  2018. Recently, Elise Stefanik, member of Con gress, also introduced a legislative initiative to fill  the gap in a coherent national strategy.25Ethics – New government, new priori ties: Since the inauguration of the Trump  government, ethical issues have appar ently no longer played a major role in the  White House AI strategy.18 The strategy of the  Obama government included requirements  for more transparency in AI-supported deci sion processes and suggestions for ethical  governance architectures, such as a two-step  monitoring architecture for both the opera tional and the ethical and legal evaluation of  AI applications.19 However, in documentation  from the AI summit held in May 2018, these  issues are no longer mentioned. The summit  materials merely contain potential negative  consequences for employees.20 Although AIrelated ethics is not publicly discussed by the  Trump government, the authors of this study  know from discussions with senior officials  in departments and agencies that the issue specific AI applications.11 So far, however, no docu mented national strategy from the new adminis tration is discernible.12 II.) Requirements for AI After China and India, the USA has the most  internet users with 246 million (2016)13 provid ing potential data for AI. The data pools of some  technology companies are even larger. Face book alone has more than two billion users every  month.14 There is a need for improvement in the  quality and availability of public-sector data, with  the US ranking third among this study’s six coun tries on the Open Data Barometer behind Europe  (in the comparison set).15 The AI leadership posi tion of the USA also becomes evident in super computers and semiconductor manufacturing,16  as well as AI talents. The USA has the world’s larg est pool of young researchers with an estimated  10,000 master’s and doctoral students graduating  each year from computer science departments  with active AI research initiatives.17 III.) Institutional frameworkremains an important consideration. Further more, in addition to work by non-governmen tal organizations and companies, Congress  has addressed the ethical implications of AI.
13United States of America IV.) Research and Development With investment of approximately 445 billion  Euro (2016)26 by the private sector (62 percent),  the government (25 percent), private universities  (four percent), and civil society, the USA is world  leader in terms of total R&D spending.27 The pri vate sector’s share of such funding is increas ing in the US, but it still lags the private-sector  percentages in China, South Korea and Germany.  However, the volume and ratio of investment  for AI-specific R&D funding is unclear. In 2015,  government investments in unclassified R&D (i.  e.  not considered secret) were 950 million euros,28  according to Obama government strategy docu ments. The Trump government announced a 40  percent increase to 1.3 billion Euro in May 2018,  “in addition to the substantial classified invest ments in defense and intelligence.”29 However, no  figures are available for this. In the research fields of computer vision, machine  learning, data mining, and natural language process ing, the USA are in the lead. Since 2016, the num ber of institutes actively engaged in research has  been at about 126.30 This is more than the total  number of AI R&D facilities in the other exam ined countries combined. Regarding the number  of scientific AI publications, the USA ranks second  behind China. However, measured by the influ ence and impact of the publications (H index)31 it  remains in the lead. According to Chinese scien tists, this will not change in the near future.32 Fields of research and instruments   for advancement of research Even though the priorities of the Trump govern ment for investments in AI R&D still need to be  finalized by the announced committee,33 one  can assumed that the focus will remain on the  promotion of basic research rather than applied  research.34 This assumption is supported by the  expected annual investments of 90 million Euro in  basic research and labor-market research at the  interface with AI, as announced in May 2018 by  NSF Director Dr. France A. Cordova,35 and as sug gested by the government’s R&D funding priori ties for fiscal year 2019, which are aimed at early  phase and basic research by the federal agen -cies.36 This concept is consistent with Obama’s  policy of using public funds as a complementary  means to those from the private sector, which are  focus mainly on application-oriented R&D.37 The  Obama administration saw a need for funding  of basic research projects in fields such as data  analysis, theoretical models for performance effi ciency of AI and hardware, and a range of topics  dealing with “Interaction between man and AI.”38  (See chart 1). The Obama administration’s strategic plan con tained a list of application areas, including agricul ture, education, medicine, production, and law,  but it did not describe which ones the economy  and public sector should support. Only the fund ing focus on public goods is mentioned, since  investments by the private sector cannot be  expected due to the lack of commercial benefit.39 No explicit focus was placed on General AI , a subcategory of AI that would enable a machine to The AI R&D strategy plan of the Obama  government  consisted of seven sub-strat egies: 1. Long-term investments in AI research 2. Development of effective methods for  cooperation and interaction between   man and AI 3. Understanding and addressing the ethi cal, legal and societal implications of AI 4. Ensuring safety and security of AI systems 5. Development of common public data  records and environments for AI training  and testing 6. Measurement and evaluation of AI   technologies based on standards and  benchmarks 7. Better understanding of national needs  for R&D personnel in AI   The strategic plan closes with recommenda tions for the development of an implementa tion plan and preparation of a needs assess ment for the labor market.
14One of the most successful research programs  of the government is DARPA, an DoD agency that  is responsible for inventions such as the Inter net and GPS. DARPA divides AI development into  three “waves.” While previous DARPA AI invest ments aimed at further development of rulebased AI (“first wave”) and statistical learningbased AI (“second wave”), DARPA today focuses on  the contextual adaptability of AI (“third wave”) –  i. e., a theory and application of AI that deals with  the limits of the technologies from the first and  second waves.47 The Artificial Intelligence Explora tion program, which was launched for this pur pose in July 2018, allocates funds of up to 800,000  euros in an uncomplicated and quick manner to  successful grant applications.48  That instrument is part of a comprehensive AI  investment strategy at DARPA, which matches the  overall effort of the DoD. According to an analysis  by market research company Govini, spending on  AI, big data and cloud has increased by 32.4 per cent to 6.3 billion Euro between 2012 and 2017.  DARPA accounted for 28.5 percent of the invest ments for the three most critical sub-segments:  deep learning, machine learning and natural lan guage processing.49 V.) Commercialization In addition to the globally active “digital  barons,”50 – such as Google, Apple, Facebook,  or Amazon, each of which manages enormous  financial resources and data volumes – the  most (approx. 1,400)51 and most influential (77  of the Top 100)52 AI startups are established in  the USA. The application areas focus on cyber  security, healthcare, marketing and sales, as well  as business solutions (see chart 2). The proxim ity to research and funds has a highly promo tional effect on the startup environment. From  2012 to 2016, 17 of the 18 most active and AIsavvy investors in startup ventures were from  the U.  S. Accordingly, it was there that most AI  investments were made in 2016 (62 percent of  the global investment volume of around 4.3 bil lion Euro).53 However, other countries are catch ing up. In 2012, 79 percent of the AI deals were solve a variety of different tasks, comparable to  human cognitive abilities. The authors of the strat egy pointed out that “long-term concerns about  super-intelligent General AI should have little influ ence on today’s policy”  and that “the best way to  increase capacities to deal with long-term specula tive risks is to address the short- to medium-term  risks such as security and data protection.”40 Although the Trump administration’s priorities  have not yet been determined, according to Krat sios the focus is on applications fields of defense  and security as well as economic advancement.41  The memorandum on priorities in R&D in the  2019 budget, which was addressed to the federal  agencies, adds the focus areas of energy and  health care to the list of priorities.42 As far as the instruments for research promotion  are concerned, the USA represents the AngloSaxon research model, which is characterized by  competition-driven science funding and college/ university budgets that are heavily dependent  on third-party funding. This is also reflected in  the funding programs of the federal authorities  and the NSF, which implement the government’s  research funding. In the fields of computer sci ence, mathematics and statistics, the Department  of Defense ( DoD) and the NSF provided 83 and  79 percent of such R&D funding in 2016.43 Experts  assume that since 2017 the subsidies among  the institutions have shifted in favor of the DoD.  The NSF was founded in 1950 with the aim of  “promoting the progress of science, of support ing national health, prosperity and well-being, to  ensure national defence.”44 Support and funding  will be particularly provided in the field of basic  research in all sectors (except medical research),  not by hiring researchers and setting up new  laboratories but by financing research at exist ing institutions. The only priority goal highlighted  in the Foundation’s Strategic Plan 2018–2022 is a  similar market-oriented approach put forward by  Kratsios:45 The “development of public and private  partnerships to increase the impact of NSF invest ments and contribute to the competitiveness and  security of the American economy.”46United States of America
15closed in the U.  S.54 Five years later, in 2017, a Chi nese company (Bytedance) reported the highest  capital (2.68 billion Euro) of the Top 100 startup  companies, for the first time.55 Between 2015 and  2017, an average of 74 percent of the interna tionally enforceable AI patents originated in the  USA (assignee country) .56 However, the number  says nothing about the quality of the patented  innovations. Regulation: “The way I think about the regula tory structure for AI, is that a thousand flowers  should bloom early in a technology,” Obama said  in 2016.57 Implementation of this is achieved through cau tious and incentive-generating state regulation,  according to the Anglo-Saxon understanding. The  foundation for this is formed by three acts:  (1) The Bayh-Dole Act (1980) allows American  universities to exploit intellectual property from  government-sponsored research. (2) The Small Business Innovation Development Act  (1982) supports small enterprises with commer cialization of new technologies, followed by the  Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR),   which facilitates technological innovation and par ticipation of small businesses in government R&D  activities and subsequent commercialization of  such activities.  (3) The Small Business Research and Development  Enhancement Act promotes scientific and techno logical cooperation among universities and small  enterprises and permits grants for technology  transfer to small enterprises. This results in pro fessionalization of the players involved and strong  interdependence between universities and indus tries (second only to Switzerland).58 To strengthen knowledge transfer between public  institutions, science and other organizations, the  Obama government discussed the expansion of a  personnel exchange program (see text box). Inte gration of different perspectives in the develop ment of AI was considered an instrument for risk  minimization against discriminatory AI systems.59The Intergovernmental Personnel Act Mobility  Program  provides for the temporary exchange  of personnel among governments, colleges  and universities, Indian tribal governments,  government-funded R&D centers, and eligible  organizations. The Obama strategy saw this as  an opportunity to promote knowledge transfer  and thus ensure effective regulation of tech nologies such as AI. To adequately promote AI commercialization, the  Trump administration considers the reduction  and elimination of innovation-inhibiting factors  its most decisive action.60 For example, it consid ers it necessary that states and municipalities to  have permission to carry out innovative drone  operations, which so far have been banned by  federal aviation authorities.61 The development  of more effective regulation for autonomous  driving is also seen as a core issue, because the  first countries or regions to adopt an effective  regulatory framework for autonomous driving  can expect to benefit from investments made by  vehicle manufacturers and providers of intelligent  infrastructure and other support services, regard less of their respective stage of development in  AI. As early as in 2017, the Department of Trans portation published an update of the 2016 Federal  Automated Vehicles Policy , which provides devel opers of automated vehicles with non-regulatory  guidance for safe integration of driverless vehi cles in the United States.62 Moreover, in April 2018,  the National Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  approved the first AI-based medical diagnostic  device.63 However, other government regulations, espe cially immigration regulations, weaken the lead ing position of the USA. The Center for American  Entrepreneurship has found that 43 percent (2017)  of the Fortune 500 entrepreneurs are immigrants  or children of immigrants.64 The consequences of  immigration policy can be seen in the example of  Sara Sabour, a young Iranian researcher at Google  who was denied a US visa and therefore moved to  Toronto, together with Geoffrey Hinton, a leading  Google AI expert.65United States of America
16The public sector as users of AI: The strategy  documents do not only consider the public sec tor as a promoter and investor, but also as a user  and beneficiary of AI. The USA ranks second in the  world (behind the United Arab Emirates) in the  procurement of advanced technology by public  institutions.66 During Obama’s presidency, the vol ume of public procurement was identified as an  opportunity to create incentives for the develop ment of ethically correct, transparent, and fair AI  by setting appropriate targets.67 Even if the man agement agenda of the Trump government does  not explicitly include AI, it still represents a central  pillar for increasing the efficiency of public admin istration.68 Sharing of public data will be given a  central role to promote AI applications outside  the public sector. In addition, the General Services  Administration (GSA) is conducting pilot programs  using AI, including a tool predicting expected  compliance with rules and regulations, which is  planned for this year’s production in Cloud.gov.69 Another concrete example is DIUx, which was  founded in Silicon Valley in 2015 and represents  “an agile government entity” that provides capital  to companies in order to solve national defense  problems.”70 Investments are made within 90 days  in the form of so-called pilot contracts, lower ing the hurdles for possible follow-up contracts.71  Although integration of DIUx-funded innovations  into the DoD proves to be difficult and the cultural  divide between the military and Silicon Valley can  occasionally encumber cooperation, the DoD also  plans to hold on to DIUx under Trump.72United States of America

18 ›The Chinese strategy is the only one of the compared documents that contains   measurable economic goals and benchmarks  ›Efforts to centralize AI support and funding and to control the use of AI  ›Promotion of AI basic research through new institutes and apprenticeships and   the recruitment of researchers through the Thousand Talents  program  ›Training in what is referred to as “AI+” professions that overlap with AI  ›Development of thematic innovation platforms in cooperation with technology companies I.) Introduction  The government in Beijing considers AI to be a  “strategic opportunity” to lead the country into a  knowledge-based economy. The strategy pub lished by the State Council in July 2017 plans  implementation of this in three steps:  ›Catch up with the leading AI nations by 2020  and create an AI industry worth 19 billion Euro  and related industries worth 126 billion Euro;  ›Become the world leader in AI by 2025  and increase the value of the AI industry to 51  billion Euro and related industries to  635 billion Euro;  ›Achieve supremacy by 2030, with an industry  worth130 billion Euro and the related indus tries worth 1.2 trillion Euro.73 At the moment, the strategy still reads like a  “wish list for Santa Claus”74 and contains only few  concrete proposals for achieving the established  objectives. However, experts say the visions could  become reality because of the country’s size and  ability to experiment.75China   Catching up and overtaking –   with massive capital investment 
19China Much like the One Belt , One Road megaproject,76  investments in AI are aimed at global influence,  although there are many domestic policy motiva tions as well. Similar to South Korea, the victory  of Google Deep Mind’s “AlphaGo” in the Chinese  game Go is considered a “Sputnik” moment in  China, as evidenced by the sudden post-match  increase in search queries for “Artificial Intel ligence” on Baidu (the equivalent of Google in  China).77 In addition, a study by the McKinsey  Global Institute calculated that half of the coun try’s economic activities could be automated.78 In  addition to risks for the labor market, AI offers  the opportunity to keep production levels stable  despite an ageing population. The exploding costs  of health care could also be reduced, corruption  could be combated more efficiently and a more  effective transport system could be established.79 II.) Requirements for AI Apart from India, no other country can match the  enormous data volume of the estimated 730 mil lion Chinese internet users.80 It must be noted that  China ranks last among the six included countries  in terms of the availability and quality of public  data (19.64 out of 100 points).81 However, this is  compensated by the data pools of the large Chi nese technology companies, which are filled by  one billion users per month through Facebook  competitor WeChat alone.82 In addition, the state  system allows the government to collect and use  data much more systematically than in the USA,  for example. Paired with the highest number of  top supercomputers (208/500)83 and the largest  estimated talent pool after the US,84 China has  the best basic prerequisites to further expand its  global position in the field of AI. As for strategic  weaknesses, a lack of cutting-edge semiconductor  products was revealed in 2015, when the US gov ernment banned chip manufacturers from selling  semiconductors to China.85The national AI plan of the State Council carries  much weight in centrally controlled China, espe cially as it fits perfectly into the “Chinese dream”  of Xi Jinping. The document not only systema tizes promotion and funding of AI, which has  already been laid out in various strategic plans,87  it also reorganizes institutional responsibilities at  national level. AI-related strategies, such as the  “Internet Plus” plan and the “Three-Year AI Imple mentation Plan,” are accounted for by the State  Commission for Development and Reform, the  Ministry of Science and Technology, the Ministry  of Industry and Information Technology, and the  Cyber Space Administration of China .88 The AI plan of  the State Council, on the other hand, provides for  the establishment of a new office managed by the  Ministry of Science and Technology, which will be  responsible solely for implementing the strategy. This corresponds to a general tendency towards  centralization, as shown by the government’s  attempts to control domestic technology compa nies (cf. Commercialization chapter).III.) Institutional framework Ethics, a topic of secondary but growing  importance In China, data protection and the ethical  implications of AI have so far lagged the  economic considerations. AI laws, regula tions, ethical standards and security controls  are going to be established in a step-by-step  manner, but only from 2020 onwards (to be  fully in force by 2030). The Social Credit System  planned for 2020, for example, serves more  to control society and avoid political and  social conflicts than to protect data. Also, the  last paragraph of the Public opinion guidance  strategic plan does not leave any doubt that  intentions are to control public opinion. Still,  ethical questions are gaining in importance  among experts, as revealed by discussions  about “moral machines” and stronger con trols that arose from a report by the Tencent  Institute.86 
20China IV.) Research and Development Although R&D spending in 2016 was only around  2.1 percent of GDP, in absolute terms China  spends the most money on R&D worldwide after  the US.89 Similar to South Korea, more than threequarters of research investments are made by  companies, which leaves the conclusion that  there is a general dominance of applied research.  The boundaries between business and govern ment are not altogether clear, so it must also be  assumed that the economic objectives of the AI  strategy will be achieved through government sup port for research and development. In relation to  the overall population, the number of scientists is  comparatively low,90 and there’s also a lack of AI  researchers. Since 2016, about 271 scholars have  been performing active research in the fields of AI,  computer vision, machine learning, data mining,  natural language processing and robotics. They’re  at eleven institutes with an estimated 800 doctor ate students per year.91 And while the McKinsey  Global Institute assumes that there are more insti tutions (30 instead of 11),92 these figures are still  too low to fulfil the requirements to achieve lead ership in AI research. Measured by the number of  scientific AI publications, the country has already  achieved global leadership (in 2017, with 11,383),  but the impact of such publications lags that of the  American and British researchers, and in the coun try achieved only sixth place in the field of statistics  and probability.93 The high number of publications  in relation to the rather low influence leads to the  conclusion that there is less scientific innovation. Fields of research and instruments   for advancement of research The status as one of the “leading global AI hubs”94  is mainly the result of private investments in appli cation-oriented R&D, which resulted from the  government-promoted rapprochement of univer sities and companies since the 1980s. As part of  the reform and open-door policy, the universities  were granted greater autonomy and public fund ing was cut in order to stimulate the acquisition of  third-party funds, which led to a concentration on  commercialization. As a result, however, “The pri ority of pursuing rapid economic benefits, social  capital and hierarchical status has reduced the incentives for researchers to undertake long-term  basic research.”95 In response to this weakness,  the AI strategy intends to fund basic research in  various theoretical areas.96 Another dimension the  strategy uses to define focus areas is technology  systems.97 In order to advance these areas and  systems, new institutions, courses of study and  doctoral programs are going to be established,  although without defining any specific objectives.  Like the technology companies,98 the government  wants to address the lack of talent and has thus  initiated the Thousand Talents program as early as  2008. It is intended to bring back renowned Chi nese scientists, academics and entrepreneurs liv ing abroad and to facilitate international experts’  access to Chinese research institutions. Reduced  bureaucracy and financial incentives have already  lured many talents back – albeit not the “best of  the best.”99 Researchers who have done their PhD  degrees in the USA hardly come back and, if so,  only do so on a temporary basis. The framework  conditions for research are more important than  the financial incentives. Alibaba, SenseTime and  other technology companies are reacting to the  double problem of a shortage of skilled workers  and inadequate basic research in a rather prag matic manner, setting up their own billion-dollar  research laboratories in the USA.100 On the labor and talent front, the government  also plans to support both educational institutions  and companies in training the workforce and pro moting young talent. And it has expanded training  of Chinese students and workers to strengthen  what it refers to as “AI+” (see text box). In this manner, China is following an approach  similar to the Japanese under what they call Digi tal Society 5.0. By “AI+” professions  the government means  professional fields in the areas of econom ics, social affairs, management, or law at the  interface with AI. To achieve this, the strategy  provides for a stronger combination of train ing in AI and mathematics, computer science,  physics, biology, psychology, sociology, law  and other disciplines.
21China The army has also become aware of the disruptive  potential of AI to gain a decisive advantage over  competing powers. Much like DARPA in the USA,  it promotes application-oriented R&D on intel ligent and autonomous unmanned systems, AIenabled data fusion, information processing and  intelligence analysis, war games, simulation and  training, defense, offense and command in infor mation warfare, as well as AI support in planning,  command and decision-making.101 V.) Commercialization The enormous size of the internal market holds  great potential for the expansion of AI applica tions. The Chinese “digital barons” – including  Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent (see chart 3) – are  already capitalizing on this advantage.102 At the  same time, the country is home to the second larg est number of AI startups worldwide (383), behind  the USA,103 eight of which CB Insights considers to  be among the most influential.104 In 2017, China  accounted for the world’s highest share of equity  financing in AI startups (48 percent versus 38 per cent in the USA),105 as well as the AI startup that  collected the most venture financing worldwide.106  The positive developments are also reflected in an  explosive increase in patent publications, in par ticular for the keyword of deep learning .107 Accord ing to this, China is eight times greater than the  USA (see chart 4). However, an in-depth analysis  (chart 5) illustrates that only a very small pro portion of the Chinese patents have an interna tional equivalent, which would make the patents  enforceable outside the country. (Between 2015  and 2017, an average of just 1.3 percent of Chi nese AI-related patents had international equiva lents, compared with 74 percent for the USA.108)  Against the background of this imbalance, the  question arises as to how the country will make  use of its constantly growing global influence to  help shape the international patent regime, or to  build up its own regime of institutions, for which  there are already precedents. Regulation: With stronger control mechanisms –  through party committees in companies, for  example – the government intends to increase its influence on the tech giants.109 Chinese com panies still enjoy great advantages over global  competitors due to the protected market. How ever, questions remain about their ability to com mercialize internationally, since their AI applica tions are based on culturally, linguistically and  geographically bound data, the limits of which  are also set by the “Chinese Intranet.”110 In addi tion, there is growing awareness and regulation  of data protection (such as the DSGVO) in the  U. S. and Europe, which will make it more difficult  for Chinese companies to export their AI prod ucts developed under domestic data protection  standards111 or to collect data in these markets  and to exploit them using Chinese procedures. The government is expected to promulgate more  regulations and laws to protect intellectual prop erty and establish standards for autonomous  driving, service robots and safety management,  according to a January 2018 white paper from  the Chinese Institute for Standardization of Elec tronics (CESI).112 In order to help shape the devel opment of a global governance structure for AI,  the country is already active in an AI subcommit tee of the International Organization for Stand ardization.113 To promote an intelligent economy and further  strengthen the collaboration between R&D and  applications, the strategy provides measures  to support new AI industries, modernize exist ing industries, establish AI innovation guiding  lights and develop AI-innovation platforms.114 ,115  In addition, pilot projects are planned to open  up access to government data and set up AI  open source hardware and software infrastruc ture platforms. Although the strategy on how  platforms should work remains vague, there are  examples already available: Alibaba Cloud’s “City  Brain” AI platform, which aims to create “smart  cities”; a “smart” public health service on Ten cent’s AI platform; and autonomous vehicles on  Baidu’s Apollo platform.116 The public sector as users of AI: In addition to the  social credit  system noted above and the different  AI platforms the state uses, the defense sector is  particularly important. With regard to commer -
22China cialization of military AI applications, China has  an advantage over the USA. The Chinese model  of civil-military fusion stands in sharp contrast to  the cultural resistance the Pentagon encounters  in Silicon Valley . The greater cooperation between  the private and public sectors will be helpful in  realizing and implementing the required applica tions in the fields of big data, cloud-computing, AI  and other cutting-edge technologies for the devel opment of a joint mission control system.117 The government also looks at the wider context  of public goods to create markets for AI appli cations, doing so in areas where it sees high  demand. The Chinese government currently  ranks tenth in the world in the procurement  of advanced technologies.118 Infrastructure and financial support: Parallel  to these efforts at the national level, cities and  provinces (e.  g. Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin) are  developing their own AI plans and strategies. In  January 2018, the city of Beijing announced the  construction of an AI park for roughly 1.8 billion  Euro to promote research and commercializa tion through startups in partnership with foreign  universities. The new AI Park will focus on attract ing companies in the fields of big data, biomet ric identification, deep learning and cloud com puting .119 Shortly afterwards, the city of Tianjiin  announced plans for a roughly 12.8 billion Euro  fund for investments in the AI industry and higher  education.120 This sum alone is about eleven  times greater than the total volume of deals in  the British AI sector. Among other things, scien tific institutions will receive around 3.8 million  Euro when they settle in Tianjin.The national government also established a sepa rate industrial investment fund of 15 billion Euro  to support the semiconductor industry, support ing the development of advanced manufactur ing processes, mainly through foundry services,  and to encourage creation, growth or mergers of  companies.121 ,122 As a result, the construction of  ten new semiconductor plants and foundries was  planned for 2016 and 2017.123 These develop ments are noteworthy, as traditional computer  architectures are reaching their limits for the use  of AI. Advanced materials technology is therefore  considered to be the “key to opening up the com mercial value of AI.”124

24Great Britain  Outstanding AI science,   challenges in commercialization  ›Promotion of AI through an agreement between the private sector and the government;  ›The Alan Turing Institute is the primary conduit for efforts to promote research   and commercialize universities’ intellectual property.  ›Priority is also given to ethics and AI through a dedicated center and a planned   international conference on the development of AI governance standards.  ›As a result of Brexit, there are also signs indicating closer cooperation with the USA. I.) Introduction  With the AI Sector Deal, an agreement between the  public and private sectors, the British are showing  their plans to establish and strengthen the coun try as a leader in AI. This is one of four deals125  included in an overriding industrial strategy that  pursues the vision of making the United Kingdom  the world’s most innovative economy, creating  good jobs and higher productivity, improving the  infrastructure, being the best place for business  startups, and ensuring prosperity in communi ties.126More than one billion Euro will be used to pro mote education, build infrastructure, create a  conducive business environment and estab lish sites for AI R&D. Of this sum, approximately  673 million Euro comes from newly allocated  funds and about 382 million Euro from existing  budgets. Both include state, industrial, and uni versity contributions. Another 280 million Euro  are intended for “connected and autonomous  vehicles.”127 There is no schedule for the provi sion of the funding. 
25Great Britain II.) Requirements for AI With around 62 million internet users, the coun try can only draw on a comparatively small pool  of private data,128 but it is the world leader in  terms of high-quality public sector data.129 In  addition, internet users are less skeptical about  sharing data than their continental European  neighbors.130 The country also has a good approach to train ing young AI talent. Since 2016, an estimated  950 master’s students graduated annually from  institutes that have been actively researching AI-   relevant fields.131 However, with only 22 of the  500 most powerful supercomputers, the country  has a strategic disadvantage in terms of comput ing power,132 and there is no domestic semicon ductor production. The withdrawal from the EU also means that  the country will lose ready access to the common  market and the user data of continental Europe ans, as well as a direct influence on the orienta tion of R&D funding priorities within a possible  pan-European governance of AI in Brussels. In  contrast, an agreement concluded with the USA  in 2017 paves the way for closer transatlantic  research cooperation.133 Due to the US leader ship role in AI, this could generate greater added  value for the country than the connection with  the EU. III.) Institutional frameworkThe AI Sector Deal was produced in April 2018  under the overall management and guidance of  the Secretaries of State for the Department for  Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS)  and for the Department for Digital, Culture,  Media & Sport (DCMS), along with AI experts Pro fessor Dame Wendy Hall (University of Southamp ton) and Jérôme Pesenti (Facebook). The deal will  be implemented by the Government Office for  Artificial Intelligence,  which initiated an AI Coun cil in June 2018 to advise the office and oversee  operations.136 One of the first tasks of the office  is to develop implementation plans and success  benchmarks for each of the individual sections of  the AI Sector Deal . In addition to these initiatives,  the House of Lords’ Select Committee on AI deals  with the AI issues in a detailed report ( AI in the UK:  ready, willing, and able? ). The report represents the  results of a ten-month analysis of the economic,  ethical and social impacts of AI innovation and  was supported by international interviews, includ ing in Germany and France. IV.) Research and Development The country has the best prerequisites for AI-   relevant R&D of the six nations considered in this  part of the report. While R&D spending as a per centage of GDP ranked last among the six (1.69  percent in 2016) and it ranked fifth in absolute  figures behind France and Germany,137 the output  from British AI research is impressive. Between  2016 and 2018, for example, there were about 136  scholars from 15 institutions actively involved in AI  research (third place behind the USA and China). In addition, an estimated 400 PhD students  per year are writing their doctorate theses on Ethical AI? The UK lays the foundation and  establishes facts While Macron speaks of Paris as the Euro pean center of ethical AI discussions, con crete measures are already being developed  in London regarding ways to develop ethical  norms for the use and development of AI.  The report by the UK House of Lords (AI in  the UK: ready, willing, and able? ) argues that  the UK has an opportunity to become the  global leader in the development of interna tional standards for AI.In June 2018, the government formed the  Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation Consul tation as an advisory body for this purpose.134  And a global summit on this subject is already  planned for 2019. However, Lord Puttnam, a  leading British politician, has said the loss of  EU integration will weaken the country’s influ ence on ethics and AI globally.135
26Great Britain research topics related to AI.138 Although Brit ish researchers only contributed around 2,250  publications on AI topics in 2017 (about a quarter  of Chinese publications), their influence is at the  forefront globally (second place in the H index).139 Fields of research and instruments   for advancement of research The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research  Council (EPSRC), the central government agency  for funding research and education in the engi neering and natural sciences has assumed a criti cal role in the British AI ecosystem. The council is  managed by and reports to the Alan Turing Insti tute for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence,  which was founded in 2015.140 Its tasks include  research, advising decision-makers, and devel opment of guidelines to support the justification  of AI decisions.141 As a national organization, the  institute can work across multiple disciplines and  in partnership with universities, industry and gov ernment. This close network between the pub lic and private sectors resembles the pragmatic  cooperation approach applied in the USA and dis tinguishes itself from the rather philosophical and  normative orientation of continental European  countries.142 In its “Ideas” chapter, the AI Sector Deal provides  for government research investments amount ing a total of 475 million Euro, which will be dis tributed by the EPSRC. Approximately 47 mil lion Euro of this funding is intended for the Alan  Turing Institute, and about 93 million Euro is  earmarked for 159 research grants in AI technolo gies.143 A detailed weighting of research priorities  is illustrated by the distribution of the research  funds that was charted out by the EPSRC and  the Alan Turing Institute’s research focus areas.  (See chart 6) According to that and as of Septem ber 2018, the EPSRC’s financial support focuses  on robotics (21 percent), statistics and applied  probability calculation (18 percent), information  systems (16 percent) and man-computer interac tion (12 percent). From a sector standpoint, the  plan targets information technology (13 percent);  aerospace, defense and marine applications (10  percent); as well as the environment (8 percent).  Other sectors include healthcare, energy and the transportation system.144 The research schemes of  the Alan Turing Institute, which are partly financed  by private economic partners, cover the areas of  policy development, health care, data science in  economics, defense and security, data-centered  engineering, and data science at scale. The latter  represents research on algorithms, such as those  deployed in the area of deep learning , and the  improvement of hardware to increase the speed  and efficiency of data-driven computing tasks.145  In addition, the Institute supports other stake holders through partnerships that, among other  things, address the challenges of revolutionizing  health care; ensuring safe and intelligent technol ogy; security management in an insecure world;  understanding the economy; making algorithmbased systems fair, transparent and ethical;  developing computers for the next generation  of algorithms; using AI in the humanities; and  strengthening innovation in the public sector.146 In addition to funds for research subsidies,  investments in the labor market are also planned.  These include setting up a fellowship program  at the Alan Turing Institute and increasing the  number of publicly supported PhD positions in  AI subjects from 200 (2020–21) to 1,000 (2025)  annually. About 110 million Euro will be distrib uted by the EPRSC for doctoral scholarships,147  supplemented by contributions from the private  sector.148 To increase the pool of future research ers, the government is investing 453 million Euro  in mathematics, digital matters and engineering  at schools, including the improvement of skills  and competences among 8,000 computer science  teachers. In hopes of increasing diversity among  AI researchers and because of potential Brexit  outcomes, the strategy also aims to ease immi gration and relocation of foreign AI talent. V.) Commercialization Compared to the USA and China, the country’s  startup scene is only of middling rank, but it leads  in Europe. No other European country can claim  more AI startups (245), and four of them rank on  the list of the most influential AI startups.149 Also, 
27Great Britain several foreign AI pioneers have assured explicit  contributions to the AI Sector Deal , including  Google, Amazon and HPE from the USA, Element  AI from Canada, Ironfly Technologies from Hong  Kong, and Astroscale from Japan.150 Contributions  by large British companies, on the other hand, are  hard to find (Rolls Royce being the notable excep tion). Great Britain also leads Europe on measures  of R&D cooperation between industry and science  (worldwide: it ranks sixth).151 This is having a great  effect. More and more companies are founded by  graduates and the revenues from commissioned  research and the marketing of intellectual prop erty are increasing.152 However, these positive  results still lag far behind expectations. Parlia ment even speaks of “Britain’s historic weakness  in commercialization,”153 a fact also reflected in  the small number of AI patent publications emerg ing from the country.154 Regulation: Commercialization can be achieved  through selling licenses for intellectual property  to existing companies or through the creation of  new spin-out  companies. To facilitate this, many  universities have initiated Technology Transfer  Offices . However, most are not sufficiently effi cient due to organizational, academic and cul tural restrictions.155  The Industry Challenge  Fund, an integral part  of national industrial strategy, pursues the goal  of strengthening science and business innova tion. The fund is divided into different support  “challenges”,156 three of which are to be financially  strengthened by the AI Sector Deal  – accounting,  insurance and legal services “of the next genera tion” (22 million Euro); “Robots for a safer world”  (103 million Euro); and “Data for early diagno sis and precision medicine” (234 million Euro).157  In addition, university efforts to market their  research and innovation in cooperation with  companies will get around 280 million Euro per  year until 2021. This will be accompanied by a  110 million Euro Connecting Capability Fund, which  supports universities in pooling capacities and  exchanging best practices in commercialization.158 Besides the provision of funds for technology  transfer, the management of research and inno -vation is restructured by the Act on Higher Edu cation and Research. This includes foundation of  the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) umbrella  organization, whose main activity is managing the  Industry Challenge Fund and providing companies  with a clear understanding of the opportunities  arising from the UK research community’s intellec tual property.159 Konfer,  an initiative of UKRI, provides the  service of innovation brokerage:  The online  tool ( https:// konfer.online ) was developed to  help companies search for researchers, facili ties, equipment and financial resources and  to create opportunities for universities to find  potential research partners. A new investment fund by the British Business  Bank will also be set up to support high-growth  companies. Through joint investments with the  private sector, a total of around 8.4 billion Euro  (including 2.8 billion Euro of its own funding) are  to be leveraged. A reform of the Enterprise Invest ment Scheme (EIS) and the Venture Capital Trusts  (VCTs) was designed to help support more than  7.8 billion Euro of “innovative, knowledge-inten sive” investments in fast-growing companies over  the next ten years. Similar revisions will make it  possible for pension funds to invest in assets that  promote innovative companies.160 These meas ures are in line with investments in Tech City UK ,  amounting to 23 million Euro to promote the   digital economy ecosystem.161 The public sector as users of AI: The AI Sector  Deal also regards the public sector as a driver  of innovation and user of AI. According to the  AI Government Readiness Index, the United King dom provides the best preconditions for an AIdriven public administration,162 but the country  only ranks 24th in the world in the procurement  of advanced technology for the public sector.163  Around 22 million Euro will be invested to support  technology companies in developing innovative  and technical solutions for administration. At the  same time, the government wants to make data  publically available in order to promote research  and new business models in the private sector.164

29France  Taking the middle course   towards leadership  ›Network of interdisciplinary AI institutes (R3IA), focus also on niche topics  ›Researchers have the opportunity of working commercially for half their time  ›“Innovation playgrounds” and startup promotion  ›Administration: consulting and learning from “Station F” AI startups  ›Network of voluntary experts for consulting and security (“AI Reserve”) I.) Introduction  For France’s President Macron, AI not only rep resents a major technological revolution, but “an  economic, social and therefore a political one”  that he wants to help shape as a chief spokesper son.165 The French strategy can be described as  an “interdisciplinary cross-breed of mathematics,  social sciences, technology and philosophy.”166  In March 2018, Macron presented the strategic  cornerstones: Ecosystems comprised of talent,  research and an adventurous spirit; open data  policies; improved financial and regulatory frame works; and ethical rules.167 He underscored the need for European values to represent a mid dle course between the dominant models from  the USA and China. In a speech widely quoted  by the media, Macron announced that around  1.5 billion Euro will be available for this purpose  by 2022. However, to maintain the “digital sov ereignty” of France and Europe,168 countries will  need to cooperate – for example by forming a  joint EU research landscape for AI. France will  also pursue bilateral agreements with Canada  and other countries in hopes of becoming less  dependent on the time-consuming cooperation  in Brussels.169 A bilateral cooperation on AI is also  planned with Germany. 
30for German-French projects.181 The main instru ments to promote the commercialization of AI are  specified in the “PACTE” bill182 by the Ministry of  Economy and Finance.II.) Requirements for AI The relatively small population of the country and  the correspondingly small volume of potential  user data (as ranked among the six countries170)  leads to low scalability of AI applications. Euro pean integration would overcome this. France is  increasingly opening state data pools in recent  years, a move that has helped it quickly catch up  on the Open Data Barometer .171 Of the “Top500”  supercomputers, only 18 are in France.172 III.) Institutional framework Since 2016, a number of players from science,  politics,173 and the economy (France Digitale, ISAIFonds ) have started to tackle the topic of AI in  France, compiling reports and holding various  events. The Ministry of Economy and the Minis try of Education launched the “FranceIA”  initiative  in an effort to compile a national AI strategy. In  the report, ten working groups stipulate recom mendations for the government on the topics of  research, commercialization and social and politi cal framework conditions.174 It was Macron who  first made AI a top priority and commissioned  the mathematician Cédric Villani to develop a  more comprehensive strategy that takes ecol ogy, ethics and diversity into account.175 From  this, Macron derived the sectors of health, mobil ity and defense (but not ecology) to be areas of  application for his “National Program for Artificial  Intelligence.”176 France benefits from centralized  structures and organization of its state matters,  such as the extensive health database (SDSN).  Macron claims that Paris already has an AI eco system177 based on business and science, and  he holds centralized decision-making power and  direct control over the ministries, unlike in the  United States.  Shortly after Macron’s announcements,178 a strat egy for autonomous driving was presented and  the Ministry of Defense announced an investment  of 100 million Euro in AI research and applica tion.179 About 400 million Euro were made avail able to form a network of AI research institutes,180  along with another 180 million Euro earmarked Ethics in research The Villani report describes in much detail  the ethical problems that may arise from AI,  such as the explainability and justification of  decisions by machines (deep neural networks )  and the risk of discriminatory algorithms.183  Ethical considerations should therefore be  integrated as a topic spanning all areas of AI  research. At the moment, these considera tions are lagging behind practice, but they will  be necessary for the acceptance of AI.184 IV.) Research and Development Between 2016 and 2018, only about 17 scholars  did active research in AI areas.185 Their influence  through AI-related publications, as measured  by the H index, ranks seventh on an interna tional comparison. Their influence is greater in  the fields of computer vision, language patterns   and statistics, probability calculation and deci sion science  (ranking third).186 The research land scape is fragmented and the system of funding  it is neither efficient nor innovative.187 Approval  of applications takes up to one year, is strongly  oriented towards concrete research outputs  and has little prospect of success. Unlike in the  United States, there is also a lack of large com panies involved in financing and carrying out  application- oriented upstream research, so that  research is mainly state-funded.188 Due to the  lack of “permeability” between the academic and  private sectors (lowest of all the countries exam ined189), most French AI scientists prefer to work  in Anglo-Saxon systems.190 Strategic research fields191 In the “upstream research” report by the  FranceIA working group, the authors iden tify 36 “disruptive research topics” that they  classify into nine major research fields. They France
31France Fields of research and instruments   for advancement of research The main instrument of the AI promotion in the  field of R&D is the establishment of a national  network of “four or five … independent but  coordinated”193 interdisciplinary AI institutions  (RN3IA),194 each with a separate thematic focus.  These are jointly operated and funded by public  universities and private companies. Two of these  institutes already exist: PRAIRIE and DataIA (see  text box). The FranceIA  experts recommended   promoting all AI areas equally (see text box).195 The Villani report, on the other hand, notes that  it’s necessary to focus efforts and funding on top ics that are currently highly relevant (above all  deep learning, big data), but it’s also important  to ensure the consistent promotion of previously  neglected topics (e.  g. knowledge representation,  semantic web, distributed AI and game theory).  The report argues that these topics might already  bear “the seed of the next AI revolution”196 and  that research should not focus exclusively on  deep learning. Diversity in research is critical in  such a young field, and France might be able to  “surprise” the AI giants on topics that are currently  less prominent197 – precisely because large Ameri can and Chinese companies put their energy into  the star topics. The intention is to attract both domestic and  international teachers, faculty, staff and research ers through reduced bureaucracy in the process  to approve research proposals and by creating “innovation playgrounds” (cf. Commercialization  chapter).198 Villani suggests that entry-level sala ries at universities should be in line with those  payed by the tech giants, or at least doubled from  their current rate.199 Macron has not made a state ment on that, yet. Another important instrument  to support research is the announced consolida tion of and broader access to state data pools on  platforms that “follow a sector logic.”200 For exam ple, the Ministry of Health is already conducting a  feasibility study on the opening of the health data  base (SDSN) and its expansion to include clinical  data.201 Other sectors, such as mobility or agri culture, are expected to follow soon, possibly in  cooperation with Germany and the EU.202 Villani  also proposes the development of a super-com puter specifically for AI, one exclusively available  to French researchers and especially to the “3IA”  institutes.203 As an alternative, pooling of comput ing power through cloud Infrastructures on the  pan-European level could also make sense.204 Paris Artificial Intelligence Research   Institute (PRAIRIE) The Institute includes CNRS and INRIA, as well  as Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft.  French industry participants include Suez and  PSA.205 The primary focus has not yet been  publicized, but one current initiative (Open Lab PSA) focuses on basic and application  research for the automotive industry.206 DataIA207 Data IA includes Paris Saclay, INRIA and   engineering schools alongside private play ers such as Renault, IBM Research, EDF and  Axa. Previously, application-oriented research  focused on big data, deep learning,  digital  trust, transparency and societal issues.208 For further allocations of funds from the  announced 400 million Euro budget, AI com petitions are currently held in the fields of  medical diagnostics and the security, reliabil ity and certification of algorithms. These com petitions are intended to leverage additional  investment from the private sector.209briefly describe their respective researchrelated challenges: 1) perception (visual,  auditory); 2) interaction of man and machine  (speech recognition, decision-making aids);  3) big data; 4) justification of AI decisions and  actions; 5) machine learning (deep learning,  unsupervised learning, incremental learning,  reinforcing learning); 6) problem solving (opti mization, beyond NP, heuristic/meta-heuristic  search, multi-level reasoning); 7) decision,  autonomous agents and collective AI; 8) gen eral AI; and 9) ethical and social challenges,  acceptance and data protection.192
32V.) Commercialization Asgard Capital and Roland Berger have counted  109 AI startups in France, less than half the  amount of the UK.210 Of these French startups,  CB Insights identifies one (Shift Technology)  among the 100 most influential in the world.211  Only 3.3 percent of global AI deals were done  in France in 2016.212 Google, IBM, Samsung and  other large corporations have opened branches  and AI research institutes in the country, but  there are no French organizations that could  scale up or market AI applications globally. Regulation: To enhance the permeability between  research and commercialization, researchers at  public universities will now be allowed to work  up to 50 percent of their time as employees or  owners of private companies, in addition to their  teaching duties.213 To place experiments in “real  life” conditions and thus facilitate innovation, Vil lani proposes the initiation of “innovation play grounds” where certain regulations will be tempo rarily relaxed.214 The French authority for postal  and communications regulation (ARCEP) has  already implemented such a system for accessing  band frequencies.215 It is also planned to gradu ally establish a regulatory framework for autono mous driving by 2022216 and to regulate predictive  algorithms,217 while a national auditing system  is to check the fairness of algorithms through  ex post facto evaluations (instead of preventive  regulation).218 At the same time, however, PACTE  also envisions the extension of “strategic” sectors  in which foreign investments would be subject to  state approval.219 Currently, these would include  AI, robotics and large-scale databases, which are  considered relevant for “national security” and  critical to the country’s economy.220The public sector as users of AI: As far as pub lic procurement of advanced technology is con cerned, France ranks last among the six countries  examined.221 Within the European public procure ment law for awarding contracts, the increased  use of “competitive dialogs” with potential con tractors would ensure more flexibility in the gov ernment’s search for useful applications, allowing  discussions without the end product having to be  precisely defined in advance.222 In order to have  the necessary personnel capacities available in  the administrations, the Villani report proposes to  establish a joint AI Center of Excellence and an “AI  Reserve” – a network of voluntary experts who will  advise on the procurement of digital technologies  and support the national cybersecurity agency.223  In an effort to foster 1,000 startups and the jobs  they create,224 30 public services and authorities   have set up offices at the Station F  startup cam pus. There, they advise startups on legal frame works and, in return, learn about the innovations  developed there and how they might overlap with  state needs.225 Financial support for the promotion of  companies/ startups:  To promote “disruptive inno vation” in general and AI in particular, a 10 billion  Euro “Fund for Industry and Innovation” launched  in January 2018 to pay 100 million Euro per year for  AI and 25 million Euro per year for nano-electron ics.226 70 million per year are provided for startups  in a more generalized Deep Tech category.227France

34Finland  On its way to becoming   a top user country  ›High level of cooperation between industry, research and administration  ›Focus on adaptation, application and commercialization (e.  g. in the health sector)  ›Main sponsor, Business Finland,  awards “Innovation Vouchers” to companies and others  ›Protocol for International Data Exchange (“IHAN”) I.) Introduction  Finland only has about five million inhabitants.  There is no world-leading university. The startup  scene is modest, albeit growing. And since the  Nokia crisis in the early 2010s, it’s home to no  internationally operating platform companies.  “It’s clear that the major portion of AI develop ment and innovation will take place outside Fin land,” according to the “Finland’s Age of Artificial  Intelligence” strategy paper from October 2017.228  Nevertheless, it claims to be the “leading coun try in the application of AI” with its best achieved  “when AI aids and supports workers in their daily  work.”229 The authors of the strategy, working  with former Nokia CEO Pekka Ala-Pietilä focused on three aspects: 1) competitiveness and growth  of the private sector through the full exploitation  of AI; 2) “high-quality and effective” public ser vices through AI; and 3) adjustment of society to  the changes through AI, particularly the preser vation of work, health and privacy.230 Accenture  estimates Finland will achieve 4.1 percent growth  in its economy due to AI by 2035, making it the  economy that stands to benefit most from AI  after the US.231 In comparison to the other cases  examined, however, the commitment of around  173 million Euro until 2022 is rather modest,  mainly intended for startups and the “renewal”  of companies232 to increase their competitiveness,  while very little of the sum is spent to promote  basic research. 
35Finland II.) Requirements for AI The small population results in the smallest abso lute number of Internet users among the coun tries surveyed and, thus, Finland has smaller  domestic data resources.233 The OpenData Barom eter in 2016 ranked Finland in 20th place world wide (first place: Great Britain) for availability of  public data,234 although the country has been pur suing an open data policy since 2013.235 Finland  also has the smallest pool of talent of any of the  countries, with an estimated 60 master’s gradu ates in AI areas per year.236 Of the 500 supercom puters, only one is in Helsinki,237 and there’s no  indication that Finland will develop its own chip  industry. III.) Institutional framework The entrepreneurial and technology-oriented  center-right coalition of Prime Minister Juha   Sipilä is striving for a “leap in productivity of the  public and private sectors” with one of its five  focal points of “digitalization, experimentation  and deregulation.”238 The AI strategy was com missioned by the Ministry of Economy and Labor  and developed by a group of 72 representatives  from various ministries, as well as the economy  and science. This “steering group” will also be  responsible for providing support and consult ing for the implementation of the measures  proposed, including development of networks  around the four sub-groups (expertise and inno vation, data and platform economics, transfor mation of society and labor, and public sector).  The study suggests that implementation of the  proposals through partnerships between public  and private players – a PPP model for “ecosystem  policy.”239 The overall responsibility lies with the  Ministry of Economic Affairs, where AI is con sidered one of its “key projects.”240 The Ministry  founded Business Finland in early 2018,241 and  the organization will channel most of the prom ised AI investments into application-oriented  research, development and commercialization.242  In addition, the economic and other ministries  have presented sector strategies for AI initiatives  in climate-friendly energy,243  digital licensing, and transportation.244 Support for university research  is provided by the national Academy of Finland.  The Ministry of Local Governments and Public  Reform is responsible for structuring and acces sibility of government databases.245 This argues  in favor of a pragmatic application approach,  which is less geared towards global leadership  and more towards an increase and reinforce ment of domestic economic power. IV.) Research and Development Total investment in research and development in  2016 was around 2.75 per cent of GDP, of which  48 percent was contributed by the private sec tor and 29 percent by public funds.246 These are  expected to rise to 4 percent of GDP by 2030.247  Although the country was far behind other indus trialized nations in absolute terms with only  around 5.7 billion Euro in expenditure (roughly  on par with Singapore), in 2016 there were  around 7,000 researchers per million inhabitants  actively operating in the country, a top figure  among the countries surveyed.248 Nevertheless,  between 2016 and 2018, only about eight teach ers from the renowned Aalto University were  actively involved in AI research and in advising an  estimated 20 doctoral students there,249 the low est figure of all countries surveyed. The AI pub lications they produced resulted in few citations  and had little impact when compared with other  countries.250 Fields of research and instruments   for advancement of research In October 2017, Aalto University, the Univer sity of Helsinki and the VTT Technical Research  Center initiated the Finnish Center for Artifi cial Intelligence (FCAI). In addition to university  degrees, the organization performs research on  the basics (see text box) and offers AI courses  for schools and companies. New PhD and post-   doctoral positions for Machine Learning projects  have been announced.251 To make AI easier to  understand and more accessible for people in  non-technical fields, the center has also founded  the FCAI Society .252
36Finland FCAI also performs research for applications in  health, engineering and natural sciences,254 which  is in line with VTT’s market approach. In 2018– 2019, the Academy of Finland will provide six mil lion Euro for research in the fields of machine  learning, bio-medicine and statistics as part of the  “ICT2023”255 initiative (in partnership with Business  Finland), with another 7 million euros between  2018–2021 for “new AI applications in physics and  engineering.”256 Another important area of applica tion is outlined in the “Strategic Research Agenda  for Finland as a AI Innovation Hub for Health”257  by the VTT research institute, which is using data  from its genome project FinnG258 for commercial  purposes as well.259 V.) Commercialization Around the same time as the global financial  crisis, Nokia experienced its own crisis, selling  its mobile communications business to Micro soft in 2013 and laying off around half its work force.260 As a result, former Nokia employees and  researchers set up a PPP network of researchers  and companies, called Allied ICT Finland261 (previ ously, HILLA Center ). It’s organized in ten different  ecosystems, including the FCAI, Internet of Things,  5G and 6G infrastructure, “smart” machines and  production, augmented reality, drones and data  analysis.262 It offers 40 “test environments”263 for  development and commercialization of IT inno vation, including AI.Start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises  based in Finland can be supported through six  different support programs, with amounts of up  to 50,000 Euro if they match the amount through  their own services. (See text box on the next page)  So-called “innovation vouchers” are of particular  interest here.269 They allow companies to purchase  expertise from other companies or researchers  to develop and test new ideas. In line with that,  startups can support national and international  research projects if they work closely with compa nies. Larger companies can either obtain research  loans – half of which cover the development costs The project is funded by companies and Business Finland. Other former Nokia employees have  made significant contributions towards a growing  startup scene,264 which has recorded an increase  in venture capital investments (in 2017, approxi mately 350 million Euro). There are 45 AI startups  (South Korea has 42), a remarkable number for  such a small-population country.265 However, due  to Nokia’s troubles and a small number of AI start ups, Finland is not position well for global com mercialization and scaling of AI value chains. Still,  it can fill niches in the health sector, ethical AI (see  text box) and marketing of “test environments.” Ethics: In addition to the AI, strategy documents  deal specifically with the impact of artificial  intelligence on ethical issues and general  economic and employment trends.266 A key  document recommends plans to establish  rules that prevent monopolistic tendencies,  monitor technological developments and  clarify responsibilities for machine-made  decisions, including in the health sector or  for B2B applications.267 The innovation agency  SITRA hopes to achieve European and global  attention with the development of a Protocol  for International Data Exchange (IHAN) ,  analogous to the IBAN protocol for bank  transfers. The idea is to create a standardized  virtual identification account for everyone, as  well “common standards, principles and an  administrative model” for centralized admin istration of these accounts.268Finish Center for Artificial Intelligence: Includes work in machine learning, deep  learning, reinforcement learning and control,  data science, distributed systems, humancomputer interaction and signal processing.  It looks at the application of these technolo gies in three major areas: 1) AI for areas in  which there is hardly any data; 2) develop ment of secure methods (trust and ethics);  and 3) mutual understanding between AI  and users. Initiatives on autonomous AI, eth ical and social aspects of AI, multimedia and  computer vision, and industrial AI are being  prepared.253
37Finland of new products or services – or grants  for basic  research with a marketing purpose.270 In both  cases, networking with small and medium-sized  enterprises and research institutions is required.  It should be noted, however, that some have criti cized the impact of Business Finland  on companies’  results.271 Regulation: Since new technologies often pro duce unexpected results, it’s important to adjust  existing regulation patterns after initial experience  has been gained.272 Some legislation has already  been adapted to accommodate the academic and  commercial use of genome data from the Finnish  “biobanks.” This helped the SITRA Innovation Fund  develop its “ISAA-CUS” project for the collection  and coordination of health data.273 Further legisla tion on the use of data for AI applications (includ ing transport, forestry and health) is currently  being adapted, as well.274 After initial experience  with self-propelled buses on designated roads,  more demands for autonomous driving rules have  been raised.275 One of the priorities of the Sipilä government is  increasing the accessibility of public data pools  and making them usable for research and, more  importantly, for commercial purposes.276 For  example, data from the Ministry of Transport,277  research data278 and data from Helsinki279 are now  available, and they will be merged and pooled  in the next step. This is already happening on  the Opendata.fi platform, which has published  around 1,300 data sets and various tools for  combining them.280Additional plans will ease access to the Finnish  labor market for talent from outside the EU (Talent Boost Program ).282 Experts who want to found a  startup “with high growth potential” in Finland can  get a two-year residence permit (startup permit) ,  and their children will get easier access to interna tional schools.283 The public sector as users of AI: The Finnish  state considers itself a user of AI, especially in  the field of digitized administration and health  care, even if the administration only ranks middle  of the pack in terms of procurement of modern  technologies.284 One pilot project at the Immigra tion Department – speech recognition on the telephone – includes plans to set up a “network of  customer service robots” for all areas of adminis tration.285 For their own initiatives, public agencies  might share up to half the cost of development  and testing of “innovative procurement solutions”  with Business Finland , as long as the solution  is jointly developed with service providers and  users.286 AI Business Program –  support for startups  and small businesses281  ›Prototype development (“Tempo”):   up to € 50,000  ›Scaling ( “Young Innovative Company” ):   up to € 1.25 million in a three-step mix   of grants  and loans  ›Entry into export markets (“Into”):   up to € 200,000 (50 percent of project  costs) ›Expansion into international markets  (“Explorer” ): up to € 10,000  ›Experimentation and testing ( “Innovation  Vouchers” ): up to € 150,000 over three  years (grant)  ›Trade Fair Grant:  up to € 30,000 for  groups comprising at least four startups

39South Korea   Hidden champion of the   ”fourth industrial revolution”  ›Training of 1,400 AI talents  ›Expansion of AI basic research with a focus on brain research  ›Techparks (“Innopolis”) for close cooperation between science and industry  ›“Electronic persons” and transitional licences in test zones I.) Introduction  The March 2016 victory of Google DeepMind’s  “AlphaGo” over Korean Go champion Lee Sedol  was a key moment not only for the Chinese, but  for the Korean public as well. Go has held a spe cial cultural meaning for Koreans, and two days  after the final game of the match President Park  announced her plan to invest about 770 million  Euro in AI and accelerate existing plans. Accord ing to Park, Korean society can “ironically call  themselves lucky that, thanks to the AlphaGo  shock, I understood the importance of AI before  it is too late.”287 Even then, however, a Korean AI  professional criticized the fact that too much of  the promised money was earmarked for industry and too little for universities.288 At the end of 2016  the Ministry of Science, IT and Future Planning  (MSIP)289 published their master plan for intel ligent IT.290 It identifies AI as a technology that,  based on the internet of things, cloud comput ing, big data and mobile platforms, will “inevitably  [and] irreversibly ... lead to the fourth industrial  revolution.”291 The vision is that of an “intelligent  information society with man at the center.”292 The  government is to assume the role of a partner for  “spontaneous innovation in the private sector,”293  create the social and cultural infrastructure, and  strengthen the social safety net.294 In May 2017,  the Moon government underscored Korea’s  claim to be one of the world’s leading AI nations  with approximately 1.7 billion Euro by 2022.295 In  
40return, the government believes that GDP growth  of around 360 billion Euro is possible by 2030.296  The leading sectors of the fourth revolution in  which the government will invest are autonomous  cars, smart factories, drones and smart cities  with  smart infrastructure and green energy.297 Invest ments will promote an “intelligent infrastructure”  to support these initiatives.298 II.) Requirements for AI Although roughly 93 percent of Koreans used  the internet in 2016, the country only ranks ninth  among the countries surveyed in terms of the  absolute number of internet users.299 The coun try held one of the top rankings in the Open Data  Barometer that same year (fifth place).300 With  an estimated 200 master’s graduates per year in  subjects closely related to AI, it is roughly on a par  with Japan and ahead of France.301 Korean com panies (e.  g. Samsung and SK Hynix) are among  the global leaders in semiconductor production.  In 2017, these companies collectively generated  the second-highest revenues in the chip business  worldwide, trailing only the USA.302 At the moment,  South Korea operates only seven of the Top500  supercomputers.303 III.) Institutional framework The liberal Moon Jae-in presides over a powerful  central state.304 In September 2017, he initiated the  “Committee of the Fourth Industrial Revolution,”305  which reports directly to him and whose head  is the former startup entrepreneur and investor  Chang Byung-gyu. The committee includes eight  ministries, the presidential secretary for science  and technology, various academics, and repre sentatives of Korean conglomerates, startups and  media.306 Chang set out the main task of the com mittee as the “application of the opinions of the  private sector to the policies already adopted by  various government departments,” with a goal to  catch up with China as a competitor.307South Korea IV.) Research and Development Total investment in research and development  has posted strong growth in recent years. With  a share of 4.24 percent of GDP in 2016, South  Korea is among the world leaders in investment  rates.308 Nevertheless, the absolute amount of  around 50 billion Euro is comparable to that of  France. In 2017, about 745 million Euro were  invested in basic research and about 550 million  Euro in “promising basic technology” through  the National Research Foundation (NRF).309 The  largest investor, however, is the private sector,  particularly the large corporations such as Sam sung and LG, with a share of around 75 percent.  Private companies focused mainly on applica tion- and market-oriented R&D. The density of  researchers is at a high level with about 6,900  per one million inhabitants, comparable with  Israel and Finland.310 In AI fields, an estimated  90 doctoral students graduate each year.311 Since May 2017, the Korea Advanced Institute of  Science and Technology (KAIST) has been oper ating an AI center that focuses on research in  areas such as brain research, machine learning,  quantum machine learning, multimodal percep tion and interaction, natural language process ing, emotional intelligence, smart chips for per vasive intelligence,312 and AI for robotics.313 The  National Institute for Science and Technology in  Ulsan (UNIST) performs research on “decision and  explainability” for clinical diagnostics and financial  transactions. It has been endowed with around  12 million Euro over five years.314 Pohang University  of Science and Technology (POSTECH) conducts AI  research in computer science (i.  e. machine learn ing for decision-making and big complex web  data).315 And the renowned “Research Institute for  Electronics and Telecommunications” (ETRI) is con ducting research in cooperation with the industry,  particularly in “hyperintelligent software.”316 However, scientific publications have had little  influence outside Korea so far,317 and they rarely  are produced with international partners.318 This is  partly due to the low level of internationalization of  universities and partly due to the fact that research  results are often available only in Korean.319
41South Korea Fields of research and instruments   for advancement of research The country’s weaknesses mainly relate to a clear  underfunding of basic research to date. To coun ter this, a new proposal aims to have 1,400 AI  experts, including 350 researchers, trained and six  new AI institutes set up by 2022. Basic research is  to be funded above all in the fields of speech and  image recognition and brain research, the find ings of which will form the basis for the next step  in the development of AI (neural networks).320 The  plans intended AI as a technology to produce new  insights, which in turn are to serve the further  development of AI. Korea’s ambitions were made  clear with an announced investment of about  1 billion Euro by 2022 and the establishment of  a Korea Brain Research Institute.321,322 Applicationoriented AI research is also aim to help cut the  development cycle of medicines from 15 to seven  years.323 In order to increase the internationali zation of Korean universities, the entry require ments for foreign academics have been relaxed.324  In addition, 3,600 employees are to receive fur ther training in AI through support program until  2022. By 2025, the government wants to consoli date the data pools of all public institutions, make  them machine-readable and open them up to  developers.325 V.) Commercialization Like Finland, the benefits of AI applications for the  economy stand at the forefront of Korean con siderations, particularly for the export-oriented  industrial production by conglomerates. Korea’s  economic model, which has been very successful  in recent decades, is mainly based on the ability  of its conglomerates, such as Samsung, Hyundai  and LG, to quickly adapt technological innovations  by others, translate them into their own prod ucts and bring them to the global market cheaply  and in large quantities (i.  e. a fast-follower strat egy). However, while Korea is one of the most  innovative economies in the world, according  to Bloomberg,326 many of its companies are lag  China and the USA with regard to AI.327 To catch  up, the conglomerates are investing billions into  application-oriented R&D for future technolo -gies, opening research centers around the world  and strategically taking over AI startups abroad.  Between 2015 and 2017, around 3 percent of all  internationally enforceable AI patents came from  South Korea, securing the country’s third place in  our worldwide comparison.328 However, the inter nal structures of the family-run conglomerates are  organized in a strictly hierarchical and patrimo nial fashion. They dominate the domestic mar ket and are very closely interwoven with Korea’s  politics.329 The five largest conglomerates together  accounted for more than half of the Korean  stock market in April 2018, with Samsung alone  accounting for around 30 percent.330 This hinders  startups and SMEs, resulting in high costs for  innovation or unsustainable efforts to promote  innovation.331 This, in turn, has a detrimental effect  on Korea’s ability to produce groundbreaking and  disruptive technologies. Still, the last 40 years  have proven that this has not stopped the growth  of the Korean economy. President Moon Jae-in’s  announcement to reduce the concentration of  market power and the power of conglomerates  has so far only led to moderate success.332 Ethics: To prevent discrimination and social polari zation, political decision-makers need to  establish “precise methods for applying and  testing ethical standards at an early stage of  development”333 (e. g. with a Technological  Consequences Council consisting of repre sentatives from the government, the pri vate sector and civil society). An interesting  approach is to have copyright and liability  issues controlled by “electronic persons.”334 Perhaps in response to international criti cism from AI researchers about its (appar ently discontinued335) cooperation with the  military company Hanwha, KAIST founded a  sub-committee for ethical AI and published  a Code of Ethics for AI  on its website (see  Annex, chart 8).  336 Startup funding: The number of startups is  increasing, especially in the IT sector,337 thanks  in part to measures by the Park government, 
42South Korea including tax relief, simplification of merger laws  and state funding of startups amounting to 360  million Euro.338 In addition, more than 80 univer sities grant their students absence periods of  up to four semesters to take care of their start ups.339 In the field of AI there were only around  40 startups affected in 2017,340 none of which was  able to gain international influence.341 Gaining  access to angel investment is difficult, and less  than 1 percent of startups manage market exits  through acquisitions. An IPO takes thirteen years  on average.342 All this results in the well-trained IT  staff remaining with the conglomerates.343 There fore, the Korean master plan recommends the  establishment of an initial fund of 23 million Euro  from resources at the Korea Institute of Finance  (KIF), gradually increasing that figure by 77 mil lion Euro each year to support startups and SMEs  in the field of intelligent IT.344 Moreover, national  events will be used to identify Korean startups in  order to prepare them for international competi tions (e.  g. U.  S. Mass Challenge) and build aware ness of them outside Korea. It is also planned to  expand “hubs for the intelligent IT industry” for  startups based on the model of the already exist ing Pangyo Techno Valley, a kind of South Korean  Silicon Valley. Regulation: The National Intelligent Informa tion Framework Law will extend the existing legal  framework. Among other things, it’s designed to  treat companies’ data ownership like property  ownership and better protect it against unau thorized access.345 In addition, safety and test  standards are to be established for AI and har monized with international standards, especially  in the medical, automotive and software indus tries. Autonomous driving (Level Three) should  be achieved by 2022, at the latest.346 At the same  time, tax breaks granted in the past for the con struction of industrial robots will be reduced until  the end of 2019. In the country with the world’s  highest robot density347 there is a fear of job losses  and thus also tax losses,348 although the govern ment’s AI strategy has the potential to create  600,000 to 800,000 new jobs through “intelligent  IT” by 2030.349 “Monopolistic and (oligopolistic) practice” by platform providers, such as Google,  would be minimized through more stringent laws,  and data theft by conglomerates from smaller  companies will be prosecuted more rigorously.350 A system of “transitional licenses” is designed to  enable companies to develop their products to  market maturity while the state approval proce dures are still in progress.351 This could take place,  for example, in large-scale “regulatory-free” or  “test” zones needed in the fields of smart cit ies, robotics and autonomous cars. Once estab lished, these test zones will be interconnected to  improve “strategic local industries and to support  existing industrial clusters through intelligent IT  infrastructure.”352 The data and knowledge gained  there will then be shared with startups and small  and medium-sized enterprises in order to develop  a wider range of new services and technologies. Support by companies: One of these “test zones”  is the Industrial Artificial Intelligence Center353 at  the heavy industry site in Ulsan, which is operated  jointly by UNIST, Samsung, EWP and POSCO. It’s  part of the Deadeok Innopolis, a supra-regional  network of companies and research institutes  (including KAIST and ETRI, among others). The five  announced AI research centers were structured  to study the integration of AI into robotics, life  sciences, machines and automobiles.354 Researchbased companies settling there will be exempt  from tax for three years, receive discounts for  electricity and can draw on an investment fund.  The proximity to state authorities also simplifies  approval procedures.355  The Ministry of Industry recently announced some  1.15 billion Euro to be spent over the next ten  years on Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, thus  supporting the largest semiconductor producers  in the country. The aim is to promote the devel opment of materials for the next generation of  microchips, further development of production  facilities, and the establishment of production  lines for global semiconductor companies.356
43South Korea The public sector as users of AI: For years, South  Korea has held a leading international position in  digital administration and citizen participation.357  In terms of procurement of advanced technol ogy by the government, however, it ranks only  32nd worldwide.358 This is about to change, with AI  applications being used in tax and legal consult ing, social welfare, health care, crime prevention,359  as well as in airport security and fighting of for est fires.360 Military applications are to be used to  reduce the number of troops and for improve ment of decision-making processes.361

45Methodology Cambrian AI Index © The analysis on which this report is based  assessed the countries on the indicators that  incorporate the countries’ preconditions, the  research and development situation, and the  degree of commercialization of AI. In an attempt  to integrate these indicators and determine the  AI position of a country in an international com parison, the Cambrian AI Index © was developed.  The Cambrian AI Index consists of the three seg ments mentioned above, which in turn consist  of different components for which one or more  proxy indicators have been identified. The meth odology had to be restricted to proxy measure ments for which reliable and comparable data  from different countries were available because  the current state of the AI field produces limited  measurable outputs. This is likely to change over  the next few years, as AI-related continues to  develop rapidly.The values of the different proxies are indexed  from 0 to 1, with the USA representing the  “benchmark” value 1 against which the other  countries are measured. (The USA was selected  as the benchmark because of its current global  leadership in AI.) The mean value of the indexed  proxy values of each component is that compo nent’s intermediate value. The mean values of all  the components of a segment, in turn, results in  the total value of the segment. The mean values  of the three segments result in the comprehen sive Cambrian AI Index. Weighting was not car ried out at proxy, component or segment level,  because adequate weighting would require wellresearched empirical studies, which to date do  not exist.
46Methodologie Cambrian KI Index © Segment Component Proxy Survey Method/Source General  require mentsFramework  conditionsNetwork Readiness Index   Value (2016) Explanation: The index provides  insights about the performance of  national economies in the use of  information and communication  technologies to enhance competi tiveness, innovation and well-being.  Thus it serves as a proxy for the  framework conditions of AI.Survey based on a scale from   1 (worst) to 7 (best). World Economic Forum:  https://widgets.weforum.org/ gitr2016/ Data OpenData Barometer (2016) Explanation: In addition to individu als with internet access and busi nesses, the public sector is the third  important source of AI-related data.  The OpenData barometer assesses  governments worldwide in their will ingness to implement OpenData ini tiatives. It also measures the impact  of OpenData on business, politics  and civil society.The data for the OpenData barom eter is collected through expert inter views, self-assessments by govern ments and secondary data sources. World Wide Web Foundation:  https://opendatabarometer.org Number of Internet users (2016)  Explanation: Internet users are  persons who have used the inter net (from anywhere) via comput ers, mobile phones, personal digital  assistants, gaming machines, digital  television, etc. in the last 3 months.  This proxy measures internet users  in absolute numbers rather than  as a percentage of the population,  since the quantity of data is what  counts for AI.World Bank:  https://data.worldbank.org/ indicator/IT.NET.USER.ZS Computing  powerNumber of 500 most powerful  supercomputers per country (2018)  Explanation: Even if computing  power can be used across borders,  the availability of supercomputers to  cope with large amounts of data and  increasingly complex algorithms is a  strategic factor for a nation.The website Top500.org counts and  lists the top super computers that  are publicly known and commercially  available worldwide in semi-annual  surveys (June and November).

In contrast, the  index assigns the number of doctoral  students to the “Research and Devel opment” segment.The estimate is based on the num ber of scholars at computer science  institutes who have been actively  researching artificial intelligence,  computer vision, machine learning &  data mining, natural language pro cessing and robotics since 2016, i. e.  whose publications have been pre sented at relevant conferences. In order to determine the annual  number of Master’s graduates, the
49Methodologie Cambrian KI Index © Segment Component Proxy Survey Method/Source number of scholars was multiplied  by a factor of 7. This factor was  determined by Mark Nitzberg, Chief  Scientist for Cambrian and Head  of UC Berkeley CHAI, on the basis  of a random sample survey of top  AI research laboratories in the USA  (potential regional/national differ ences were not considered).

This  proxy is presented in absolute terms  in USD as opposed to the percentage  ratio of GDP to reflect the global and  mobile value chains of AI.The data are available in the respec tive national currency. For compara bility, all values have been converted  to USD (average exchange rate of  2016). The 2016 expenditures from  Singapore and India are not availa ble, which is why they were projected  based on historical values.

52Segment Component Proxy Survey Method/Source Patents AI patents (with international  enforcement expectations) by  assignee country in % (average   of the years 2015, 2016 and 2017). Explanation: This proxy provides  information on the patent activities  of a country’s companies. Neverthe less, this proxy is subject to reserva tion, since the patents are not indic ative of the quality of an innovation  and are often merely incremental in  nature.Although various sources suggest  that China has overtaken the US in  terms of AI-related patent applica tions, most Chinese patents have no  international equivalents and are  therefore unenforceable outside  China. The patents cover AI as well as  Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Notice: The process of patent appli cation for patent publication is  associated with a considerable time  delay, which is why the figures may  also vary retroactively. Research by M-Cam:  https://www.m-cam.com AI startup  landscapeNumber of AI startups (2017)  Explanation: The number of AI start ups provides information about  the diversity of the potentials of AI  and the innovative strength of the  national economies.The data collection focused exclu sively on startups active in the AI  technology industry and ignored  companies dealing with other digital  topics and technologies. These are  startups that produce AI solutions  and expressly excludes startups  that use existing AI solutions on the  market to develop new services or  products.

Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung e. V.The race for world leadership in Artificial Intelligence (AI)  technologies has begun. Since the publication of the AI  strategy by the Obama administration in 2016, other  countries have also started to explore ways to support  the research and development (R&D) and commercialization of AI to catch up with the US, currently the  leading AI nation. With this two-part publication, the  Konrad Adenauer Foundation intends to give a compa rative overview of the AI strategies of major national  economies to provide food for thought and inspire the  German debate. We believe “tech is politics” and our  political and civil society should debate this vigorously.
