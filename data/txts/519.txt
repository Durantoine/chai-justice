4  STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES        OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  Abstract       This is the first report on the state of implementation of the policy recommendations to  governments contained in the OECD AI Principles that were adopted in May 2019. This  report presents a conceptual framework, provi des findings, identifies good practices, and  examines emerging trends in AI policy, particularly on how countries are implementing the  five recommendations to policy makers contained in the OECD AI Principles. This report  builds both on the expert input pr ovided at meetings of the OECD.AI Network of Experts  working group on national AI policies that took place online from February 2020 to April  2021 and on the EC -OECD database of national AI strategies and policies. As policy  makers and AI actors around the  world move from principles to implementation, this report  aims to inform the implementation of the OECD AI Principles. This report is also a  contribution to the OECD AI Policy Observatory.

STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES    7     OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  Background     The OECD.AI Network of Experts set up a working group on national AI p olicies (hereafter, “expert group”)  in June 2020 to identify challenges and good practices for the implementation of the five recommendations  to policy makers contai ned in the OECD AI Principles (OECD, 2019 [1]). The expert group is co -chaired by  András Hlács, Vice Chair of the OECD Committee on Digital Economy Policy, and Michael Sellitto, Deputy  Director, Stanford Institute for Human -Cent red AI (HAI) (Annex B).   The expert group leveraged the OECD AI Policy Observatory  www.oecd.ai  (OECD.AI), containing a  database of national AI policies from OECD countries  and partner economies and the E U. These resou rces  help policy makers keep track of national initiatives to implement the recommendations to governments  contained in the OECD AI Principles. National policy  makers are the primary audience for this report.     The expert group met monthly between June 202 0 and March 2021 to discuss case studies from selected  countries during 90 -minute online meetings.  Over this period, 24 case studies were discussed during ten  virtual meetings ( Table  1). These discussions provided “ deep dives” into national experiences in  implementing AI policies and were rich in lessons learned and good practices identified for each phase of  the AI policy cycle ( Figure  1).   Members of the expert  group and g uest speakers explained the challenges they encountered and shared  insights and resources.    Table  1.

They include the Council of Europe, the  European C ommission, the Global Partnership on AI, the Inter -American Development Bank, the United  Nations, UNESCO, and the World Bank. Their involvement helped to foster synergies and minimise  duplication. The last section of this report, on International and multi -stakeholder co-operation on AI ,  provides a preliminary overview of the current work on AI governance taking place at the inter governmental level and how these initiatives are connected.   Directorates across the OE CD are analysing the opportunities and challenges that AI raises in their policy  domains. The expert group and the OECD Secretariat staff involved directly in this work have begun co ordinating with other members of the OECD Secretariat staff and delegates  from OECD bodies to seek  their input on the relevant policy areas that are covered by the OECD AI policy recommendations.   The expert group developed this report entitled “State of Implementation of the OECD AI Principles:  Insights from National AI Policie s” that identifies practical guidance and good practices for implementing  the five recommendations to policy makers contained in the OECD AI Principles. The expert group fin alised  the report in March 2021 , which was declassified by CDEP at its meeting in Apri l 2021.

10  STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES        OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  AI policy design   Countries are at different stages of develop ing and implementing national AI strategies  and policies    The development of natio nal policies and strategies focusing specifically on AI is a relatively new  phenomenon . Countries are at different stages of develop ing and implementing national AI strategies and  policies. The EC-OECD  database of national AI policies (www. oecd.ai/dashboar ds) contain s national AI  strategies and AI-related policy initiatives from over 60 countries . Strateg y and policy priorities include   financing  AI R&D institutions and projects , addressing societal challenges, promoting AI uptake  by  business , fostering  inclusive social dialogue , equipping  the population with the skills f or developing and  using  AI and fostering a fair labour market transition for workers.   Countries are using public  and inclusive  dialogue for trustworthy AI   To seek input on the design of thei r national AI policies and strategies, governments often involve a broad  range of stakeholders including citizens, civil society groups, private companies, research organisations  and others. Consultation  efforts generally seek to  identify and report on cur rent and future opportunities,  risks and challenges arising from the use of AI in society . They also look for ways to build public trust in  AI.  Effective  AI policy  implementation needs  to be co-ordinated across government   Effective implementation of natio nal AI initiatives needs  to be co-ordinated across government . AI  governance models range from assigning oversight to an existing ministry or department to creating new  bodies dedicated  to AI. Countries are pursuing different national governance models to coordinate nationa l  AI policy implementation across government  and offer  regulatory and ethical oversight. Many countries are  establishing  national AI offices  that are  tasked with oversee ing national AI policy implementation and  ensur ing policy coherence.   Several countries have established dedicated bodies to coordinate AI strategy implementation (Canada,  Egypt, Singapore, United  Kingdom, United  States); conduct technology foresight and impact assessment s  (Austria, Canada, United Kingdom, United States); o r address ethical issues (New  Zealand,  United  Kingdom). In addition, AI observatories have been established at regional ( Belgium - Flemish  Knowledge Centre Data & Society, Quebec), national (Italy, France, Germany) and international levels  (European Commis sion’s AI Watch, AI4EU Observatory, OECD.AI).   AI policy implementation    Funds to develop national AI R&D capabilities are allocated in many different ways   To invest in AI R&D, countries are funding national AI -related research institutes and projects throu gh  grants; consolidating AI research networks and collaborative platforms; prioritising AI investments in  specific  economic sectors; pursuing AI -related mission -oriented innovation policies; and procuring AI  systems for the public sector  (Figure  2). Building on digital government approaches, many national AI  strategies and policies encourage the public sector  to adopt AI  while ensuring that their systems are  human -centred  and trustworthy .

Source: Authors.   Budgets for  AI R&D vary across countries. For example, since 2020 the United  States dedicate s USD  1  billion or more annually to non-defence AI R&D and created  national AI research institutes. The EU Horizon  2020 programme  has committ ed EUR  1.5 billion to AI research over two years and expected  an additional  EUR 20 billion in 2020 from the private sector and member states.  Canada’s federal and provincial  governments have dedicated over USD  227 million (CAD  300 million) to AI research o ver 2017 - 22,  anchored in the three AI institutes created under the CIFAR Pan -Canadian AI Strategy .  Sharing  data and AI compute access are growing  priorit ies   Open a ccess to public sector data continues to be a  priority as national data strategies increasi ngly focus  on AI to foster a  robust  digital ecosystem for AI  and advance AI R&D . Policies to  promot e access to public  data and initiatives that enable private sector data  sharing include  data trust s, data dams and data spaces.   As part of their AI strategy , several countries have developed or are developing centralised , accessible  repositories of open public data sets such as  anonymi sed government health records  and satellite data   (e.g., Chile, Norway, Portugal, Spain, and the United  States). Others are look ing for ways to incentivise  data sharing in the private sector ( e.g. United  Kingdom, European Union).   Alongside data and algorithms, AI computing capacity has emerged as a key enabler for AI and AI -enabled  economic growth and competitiveness. Policies inc reasingly  prioriti se invest ments  in digital AI  infrastructure, such as high-performance -computing and cloud computing resources , to increase AI use  and adoption , while provid ing research institutions and businesses  access to these resources (Figure  3).

Source: Authors.   To boost innovative AI research ecosystems,  countries are turning to platforms for networking and  collaboration.  For example, Canada’s  Innovation Superclusters Initiative , has invested EUR 155 million   (CAD 230 million) in the Scale AI Supercluster  to advance  the development of AI -powered supply chains.  Other policy initiatives  include Colombia’s start -up incubator and accelerator C-Emprende , the Cze ch  Republic ’s knowledge transfer partnerships programme, Denmark’s digital hub for AI public -private  partnerships, Finland’s  AI Business programme , Germany’s Plattform Lernende Système , Hungary’s AI in  practice self -service online platform , Norway’s AI research consortium , Slovenia’s Digital Coalitona  and  AI4Slovenia .  A wide range of new policy initiatives aims to encourage SMEs to  innovat e and adopt  AI. Examples include  the European Commission’s AI4EU project, Finland’s AI Accelerator, the SME 4.0 Excellen ce Centres  in  Germany Korea’s  AI Open Innovation Hub , Turkey’s SME programme  KOBIGEL , and Singapore’s AI  Makerspace . Governments are also experimenting with controlled testing environments for AI systems,  including by SMEs ( Germany, Lithuania, New  Zealand,  United  Arab  Emirates, United  Kingdom,  United  States).   Some international organisations plan to translate  high-level AI principles into legal framework s while they  are considering risk-based approaches. Some countries are developing technical standards to  support the  implementation of trustworthy AI.     The use of AI systems  whose recommendations are acted upon automatically without human involvement  in the public sector has come under increased scrutiny. To ensure the development and deployment of  trustwor thy AI, governments are exploring a variety of regulatory approaches  that include : amending  existing laws; introducing requirements for the mandatory bias testing of AI systems ; prohibiting  or banning   the use of AI systems in specific contexts, or establis hing public registries to ensure  that AI systems are   
14  STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES        OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  efficient and accura te. They  are also establishing ethical oversight bodies to advi se regulators and ensure  that AI systems  are used in trustworthy ways .   Most countries have introduced guidelines for tr ustworthy AI that are largely in line with the OECD AI  Principles. Examples include Australia’s AI Ethics Framework , Colombia’s Ethics Framework for Artificial  Intelligence, Germany’s Data Ethics Commission ethics recommendations; Hungary’s AI Ethical  Guid elines , Japan’s AI R&D Guidelines and AI Utilisation Guidelines , Singapore’s Model AI Governance  Framework , and the European Commission’s Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI.    Education and training  programmes are building human capacity and monitor ing the  impact of AI in labour market s has begun   To empower people with the skills for AI and prepare for a fair labour market transition, countries are  deploying a myriad of policy initiatives, including: establishing formal education programmes on STEM and  AI-related fields  (Australia, Finland, Turkey, United  Kingdom, United  States) ; devising vocational training  and lifelong learning  on AI-related programmes  to help citizens keep up with technological and societal  changes  (Finland , Singapore ); providing financi al and non -financial support to retrain and attract top AI  talent  (Belgium, Canada, Turkey, United  Kingdom) ; fostering academic partnerships between public and  private AI research institutions  (Chile, Egypt, Korea, Germany , Turkey ); and monitoring the impa ct of AI  on the labour market for policy intervention  (Germany) . The first four categories are more developed in the  current landscape, while measures addressing broader labour market trends and challenges remain at a  very early stage of development  (Figure  5).

STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES    15     OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  AI policy intelligence  to monitor implementation   A few countries have launched policy intelligence activities and issued ann ual reports to evaluate their  national AI strateg y implementation, such as  Canada, Germany, Singapore, the United Kingdom, the  United States, and the European Commission . Several national and regional institutions have established  AI observatories to overs ee national AI strateg y and policy implementation,  and to develop indicators . At  the European level, AI Watch is developing indicators in numerous areas .  International and multi -stakeholder co -operation on AI   Many countries are engaged in international co -operation for AI  which  is taking place in fora including the  Council of Europe, the European Union, the Group of Seven (G7), the Group of Twenty (G20), the Global  Partnership on AI (GPAI), the Inter -American Development Bank (IDB), the International  Teleco mmunications Union (ITU), the OECD, the United Nations, the United Nations Educational,  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the World Bank. Cross -border  co-operation in AI   research is also a priority. For example, the French National Research  Agency, the German Research  Foundation and the Japan Science and Technology Agency are calling  for French -German -Japanese  collaborative AI research projects.  Similarly, the United Kingdom and the United States  are seeking to  strengthen  their co-operation on AI research .   In February 2020, the OECD launched OECD.AI, a platform for policy makers to monitor developments in  the AI policy landscape and the OECD .AI Network of Experts (ONE AI), a multi -stakeholder expert  group  that is developing practical guidanc e to help implement the OECD AI Principles. The OECD also hosts the  Secretariat of the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI), a n initiative  launched in June 2020 to conduct research  and pilot projects on responsible AI.

AI policy design   This section elaborat es preliminary findings on i) AI policies  that are at different stages of development ; ii)  the role of  public  consultations to promote inclusive social dialogue on AI ; iii) governance approaches  pursued by countries to co-ordinate the implementation of the ir AI policies ; and iv) insights on emerging  national  AI regulatory and non -regulatory approaches.   AI policy stages  of development   Countries are at different stages of implementation of their national AI strategies . Canada, Finland, Japan,  and the United Kingdom  were among the first to develop  national AI strategies , setting targets  and  allocat ing budgets around 2017 .  Denmark, France, Germany , Korea , Russia  and the United States   followed suit  in 2018 and 2019 . In 2020, c ountries continued to  announce  their national AI strategies,  includ ing Bulgaria, Egypt, Hungary , Poland, and Spain . In 2021, Brazil launched its national AI strategy. A  number of countries are in the consultation and development processes , such as Argentina, Chile,  Mexico  and Turkey . More  are expected to be announced .  In some countries, a head of State or Prime Minister  called for the AI strategy. France ’s Prime Minister  tasked Cédric Villani  in 2017 , the Field Me dal winner mathematician, with examining AI policies in France .  The ensuing national AI strategy was published in 2018 .  In Japan, the expert group was created by Prime  Minister  Order and develop ed Japan’s AI strategy in 2017.  In some other countries, early policy responses  to AI have taken place  at a more administrative level. In th e United States, the Office of Science and  Technology Policy  published its strategic plan on AI R&D in 2016. The United States launched its national  AI strategy in 2019 as an Executive Order by the Presiden t. In Italy, the task force  at Digital Italy publi shed  the whitepaper on AI in 2018 to identify opportunities and challenges before Italy launched its national AI  strategy in 2019.   In 2016, the Korean government published the Mid-to Long -Term Master Plan in  preparation for the intelligent information soc iety. In 2019, Korea announced its n ational AI strategy.   During 2019 -2020, s everal countries update d or complement ed their national AI strategy. The United  Kingdom published its “AI Sector Deal ” in 2018 and published an update to the Sector Deal in 2019. It also  published a National  Data Strategy which considered the importance of data for trustworthy AI  development and use. Korea published its national AI strategy in 2019 and launched Digital New Deal in  2020  to consolidate its domestic digital ecosystem. In 2020, Russia adopted the “Concept for the  development of regulation of relations in the field of AI and robotics until 2024”. In December 2020, the  US  Congress ional legislation defining  the National AI Initiative Act (NAIIA ) of 2020 became law, and expa nded  existing AI policies and initiatives of the White House and throughout the Federal Government  (Figure  6)  to ensure  continued U.S. leadership in AI R&D; leading the world in develop ing and us ing trustworthy AI  systems in the public and private sectors; preparing the U.S. workforce for the integration of AI systems  across the economy and society; and co -ordinating AI R&D  and demonstration activities between  civilian  agencies, the Department of Defence, and the Intelligence Community to ensure that each informs the  work of the others.

In most cases, a national AI strategy sets the objective or target followed by plans for action to implement  the strategy. Some countries aim t o secure a leading position in AI ( Box 1). Action plans include co ordination role of the government to ensure concerted action by all stakeholders and a whole -ofgovernment approach to the strategy.

A selection of national AI strategies’ goals and ambitions   China : China’s State Council released the Guideline on Next Generation AI Development Plan that set the following industrial  goals: i) AI -driven economic growth; ii) breakthroughs in basic theories by 2025 , and iii) to be a global AI innovation centre by  2030.   Finland : Finland published its first AI strategy “Finland’s Age of Artificial Intelligence” in 2017 and it called for policy actions  to i) enhance business competitiveness using  AI, ii) ensure top -level expertise and attract top experts, iii) provide the world’s  best public services, iv ) make Finland a front runner in the age of AI.   Germany : The German federal government published  its AI strategy in 2018  and Germany aims to becom e a leading centre  for AI, with “AI made in Germany” becoming a  strong export and a globally recognised quality mark.   Korea : Korea launched its national AI strategy in 2019 that articulated the following targets: i) for Korea to be among the top  three  coun tries in terms of its digital competitiveness ranking and ii) to be among the top 10 countries in terms of the quality of-life ranking .  United States : The United States issued an Executive Order “Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence” in  2019. The order articu lates  the importance of American leadership in AI to maintaining economic and national security and to  shaping the global evolution of AI.  On 1 January 2021, the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act entered into force .    Source: www.oecd.ai/dashboards    Policies  to promote inclusive  social dialogue on AI   Many governments involve a broad range of stakeholders to seek input on their national AI policies at  different stages of the design , implementation,  and evaluation  policy cycle . This section examines policies  aiming at promoting an inclusive social dialogue on AI, including the role of public consultations in the AI  policy design to bring diverse viewpoints and promote collabora tion among stakeholders in AI policy  development.   The OECD.AI national AI policy database  shows that different countries pursue different types of  consultations , including i ) online/offline surveys; ii) conferences and public hearings, participatory  worksh ops, and s eminars; iii) expert interviews;  iv) creating focus groups or expert groups; v) creating fora  for online discussion , and vi) establishing permanent bodies to advise and co -ordinate the implementation  of national strategies . Expert groups, partici patory workshops and seminars are the most used  methods of  public consultation.   Consultations with experts and stakeholders are a key driver for the development of AI strategies. For  example, the European Commission created a High -Level Expert Group – a committee of 52 experts that  published recommendation s on AI policy and investment as well as ethic s guidelines for trustworthy AI in  the EU. Japan created an expert group chaired by the Prime Minister to develop an AI strategy  in 2016 .  Malta’s AI Strategy was developed by Malta.AI Taskforce, a group of experts across multiple  domains.1  France consulted with over 400 experts for the development of its national AI  strategy.   Singapore received a wide range of contributions both local ly and internationally fr om key AI  personalities, private companies, research institutions and think -tanks and government agencies.2   In addition to expert consultations, some governments engage d the public more expansively to ensure that  perspectives from citizens and consumers a re considered  as part of their national AI strategy . For example,  ONE AI member Jose Guridi (Chile) mentioned that  the Chilean government organised a series of webinars  and opened a process by which  any group could organi se their workshop s and share their insights with  the gover nment . More than 7 000 people participated in this process ( Box 2). Guest speaker Gillian

The Scottish   government published a report on public engagement in develop ing its AI strategy  (Democratic Society,  2020 [2]).   Public cons ultations take place at various stages  of policy development. For example, some countries  consulted stakeholders at an early  stage. Lithuania’s ‘vision’ that lays out specific objectives were shaped  through such consultations. Latvia consulted experts and stakeholders to identify key areas for investment  and priorities of AI strategy to be developed.  In February 2020, the Latvian government released its  national AI strategy on Developing Artificial Intelligence Solutions .  On the other hand, Turkey consulte d  experts to conduct a foresight exercise to determine where the funding for public research to be allocated .3   A growing phenomenon is the establishment of independent advisory bodies, such as new AI expert  advisory councils in Canada, Egypt, Spain, the U nited Kingdom , and the United States .4 These bodies  monitor not just the implementation of the national AI strategy  and its impact , but also citizens’ trust and  perceptions of AI, to inform the government’s policy responses. For example, to better understa nd the  needs and perspectives of Canada’s AI community, the Government of Canada launched an Advisory  Council on Artificial Intelligence  in 2019 , comprised of researchers, academics, and business leaders, the  Council advises the Government of Canada on how  to build on Canada’s AI strengths to support  entrepreneurship, drive economic growth  and job creation and  build public trust in AI. The Council has  created two working groups to date, one on Commercialization and another on Public Awareness  (OECD.AI forth coming ).    
20  STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES        OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  Box 2. Public Engagement as a Public Consultation Process   Canada   The formulation of Canada’s AI strategy involves input from both non -governmental experts and citizens in consultation processes.  In 201 9, the Canadian gover nment established an AI Advisory Council to advise the government on how to build on the country’s  strength in the field of AI and to spur AI -powered economic growth. The council created two working groups: one on  commercialisation and the second on public  awareness.   Public awareness is a key area for the Council that emphasised that  policy design, including sectoral priorities, require the trust and support of the public to succeed.      ONE AI member Professor Marc -Antoine Dilhac (Canada) provided a frame work for engaging in public consultations with citizens:     Consultation, which consists of gathering existing opinions, most typically in a survey format. When done well, surveys  can provide helpful feedback for policy  makers to design and adjust policy ac tions, though particular attention should  be paid to ensuring the diversity of respondents.      Deliberation, i.e., bringing people together to meet and deliberate democratically. This involves rational discussion  through an exchange of arguments and a collective decision. The goal of deliberation is to identify common orientations  based on discus sion, rather than to express existing opinions.    Co-design, a process of conception and development, a collaborative process by which citizens elaborate on principles,  norms, and standards.      Canada’s AI Advisory Council created its public engagement and consultation processes using both consultation and deliberation.  The national survey elicited an array of citizens’ input on AI use in different sectors. The results will shape deliberative workshops  that take place online due to the pandemic. The workshop s aim to find ways to address ethical concerns raised by citizens via the  survey. Among the  goals of the deliberative process is to shape a new set of guidelines and recommendations for the development  of AI.   Some ONE AI  members highlighted the challenges  of involving the public in consultation processes on AI policy design, which is  often considered as technical and exclusive. The example of Chile was provided as a country whose government put the public  consultation process at the centre of its AI policy making, with new models to involve citizens in AI policy development. One model  is to create an assembly by appointing several dozen citizens to discuss AI policy and gain expertise. Another is to conduct  continuous consultations through online surveys. Th e AI Civic Forum is an initiative is co -directed by The Future Society,  AlgoraLab and Mila to engage the public through deliberative democracy  (AICF, 2020 [3]).  Source: Presentation by Pr. Marc -Antoine Dilhac, 10 July 2020 ( Expe rt group  3rd Meeting)   Chile   In 2019 the government of Chile started develop ing its national strategy. According to ONE AI member Jose Guridi  (Chile) , the  consultation process that went from February 2020  to January 2021  faced two different crises : social r iots and the COVID -19  pandemic. These crises allowed Chile to develop a more participatory process and create robust social dialogue to serve two  purposes : build ing a national AI strategy and increasing AI awareness and education. Through a series of 69 regional workshops ,  15 webinars with over 7000 attendants, and even a handbook, the government served as facilitator to raise awareness about AI.  It developed a bottom -up participatory approach and inclusive social dialogue to solicit  feedback from citizens to inform the design  of national AI policy. During his presentation, Mr. Guridi  highlighted the very wide range of participants drawn to AI events in Chile,  which contribute to the AI policy design process but also to learn ing more about AI.

Effective implementation of national AI initiatives hinges on co -ordination   Countries  are pursuing varying national governance approaches to coordinate t he implementation of their  national AI strategies and policies across government, offering regulatory and ethical oversight. The  horizontal nature of AI policy often calls for the involvement of several  institutions and actors. Examining  national AI strate gies at OECD.AI reveals several patterns.   To ensure policy coherence and the effective implementation  of national AI policies, governments are  using  different models : i) assigning  oversight of the development and implementation  of a strategy to an existin g  ministry or agency; ii) creating a new governmental  or co -ordination body for AI; iii) establishing AI expert  advisory groups; iv)  receiving input from oversight and advisory bodies for AI and data ethics bodies  (Figure  7.).  Figure  7. Governance approaches to national AI policy

In Brazil, the national AI strategy efforts were spearheaded by the Ministry of Science,  Technology, Innovations and Co mmunication.5 Estonia’s Ministry of Economic Affairs and  Communications created its national AI strategy.6 In India  the AI strategy is overseen by the Ministry of  Planning, a ministry focused on fostering co -operation between Indian states.7 Israel’s AI st rategy was  developed through its AI Strategy Governmental team, an inter -departmental effort with members from the  Prime Minister’s Office, Ministry of Defense, Israel Innovation Authority, National Cyber Directorate, and  Council for Higher Education.8 Poland’s AI strategy was developed  by the Ministry  of Digital Affairs, the  Ministry of Development and Technology, the Ministry of Science and the Ministry of Public Funds.  In  Russia , the implementation of the AI national strategy is overseen by the Ministry of Economic  Development.    Examples within the OECD.AI database show that the agency or government ministry responsible for  implementing national AI strategy varies among countries. At least ten countries have assigned  responsibility for AI policy coordinat ion to more than one ministry. For example, Germany’s AI strategy was  a joint project between the Federal Ministries of Education and Research, Economic Affairs and Energy,  and Labour  and Social Affairs.  Likewise, the Ministry of Industry and Technology an d the Presidency ’s  Digital Transformation Office are working together on developing Turkey’s national AI strategy.    Creating a new governmental or co-ordination body for AI   Some  countries create d a co-ordination body  to facilitate  whole -of-government imple mentation of AI  policies . For example, France co -ordinates AI  policy from within the Prime Minister’s Office , Colombia is  developing an AI Office within the Presidency of the Republic . Egypt has a National Council for Artificial  Intelligence headed by the Minister of Communications and Information Technology . Saudi Arabia’s Data  and Artificial Intelligence Authority co -ordinates its AI strategy with relevant agencies.  Serbia established  an inter -departmental group, the AI Council, to oversee the implementat ion of its AI strategy.9 Singapore  created a National AI Office. The United Arab Emirates’ Ministry for Artificial Intelligence.   In 2019, the  United Kingdom established the Office for AI. In 2020, the United States established the National AI  Initiative O ffice (Box 3).

Two key drivers for the effective implementation of AI policy: leader -level support  and  ensuring horizontal  co-ordination   US Nation al AI Initiative Office   In January 2021 the White House established the National AI Initiative Office to implement a national AI strategy, coordinati ng  AI research and policymaking across government, industry and academia. The Office was established per the National AI  Initiative Act of 2020 to serve as a hub for national AI research and policy. The Act also codified the American AI initiativ e that  plans for increased AI research investment by the federal government, access to AI compute, and the establishm ent of AI  technical standards, among others. The Act also expanded the White House -based Select Committee on AI and codified the  establishment of the national AI research institutes, along with a national strategic R&D plan.   ONE AI member Lynne Parker (US)  stressed that a key driver that has catalysed  the implementation of the US’ national AI  policies is a high-level political endorsement  from both the President of the United States who  issued an Executive Order on  AI in early 2019 and from Congress , which pass ed legislation  – the National AI I nitiative Act  – that entered into force on 1  January 2021 .   Lynne Parker also emphasised  the importance of build ing strong collaboration across federal agencies. She stressed the  challenge of coordinating across US federal agencies participat ing in AI R&D  efforts  and the key role of t he new US National  AI Initiative Office in coordinating these efforts , leveraging existing interagency coordination bodies. AI representatives from  these agencies come together to learn mor e about each other’s  missions and challenges and identify  commonalities  and  synergies . Horizontal  co-ordination has prove n valuable to develop  general models for trustworthy  AI that  can also be tailored  to particular use cases or mission priorities.     Sour ce: Presentation by ONE AI member Lynn e Parker (United States), 11 March 2021 (9th meeting).   AI expert advisory groups   Countries have also established AI expert advisory groups; multi -stakeholder groups comprising AI  experts, tasked to identify and repor t on current and future opportunities, risks and challenges arising from  the use of AI in society. These AI councils also provide recommendations to the government. These include  Austria’s Council on Robotics and AI; Canada’s Advisory Council on AI; Spain’ s Artificial Intelligence  Advisory Council; the United Kingdom’s AI Council; Poland’s Ad -Hoc Science AI Council and the United  States’ Select Committee on AI under the National Science and Technology Council  and the National  Security Commission on Artifici al Intelligence . Colombia is also developing an International Council for AI  
24  STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES        OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  to oversee the implemen tation of its national AI strategy while also inclu ding input from international  experts. Japan established the AI Strategy Implementation Council in 2018  as a dedicated bod y to co ordinate the implementation of its AI Strategy .   Oversight and advisory bodies for AI and data ethics    Some countries have created  or reformed  oversight and advisory bodies for AI  and AI -related areas . These  include Germany’s Data Ethics Commission, the Data Ethics Advisory Group in New Zealand, the United  Kingdom’s Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDEI), and  Singapore’s Advisory Council on the Ethical  Use of AI and Data.  These bodies have introduced several reports and recomm endations on the use of  data and algorithmic systems.   In October 2019, the  German  Data Ethics Commission presented a report containing recommendations  for action on the use of data and algorithmic systems (including AI systems) (Daten Ethik Kommission,  2019 [4]). In November 2020, the CDEI published its Review into Bias in Algorithmic Decision -Making  (CDEI,  2020 [5]), which sets out recommendations to the UK government and sectoral regulators on how to tackle  algorithmic bias and support organisations, whilst ensuring that the UK ecosystem is set -up to support  ethical innovation.   An emerging trend is for national data protection authorities to issue  guidance reports on challenges raised  by AI systems that relate to data protection regulation ( e.g., GDPR ). One common concern is the collection  of biometric data. I n July 2020 , the UK’s Information Commissioner’s  Office (ICO) published a framework  to audit AI systems and ensure data protection  compliance  (ICO, 2020 [6]). In February 2020, the Spanish  Data Protection Agency published a guidance report on privacy compliance of the design and use of AI based systems  in light  of GDPR  (AEPD, 2020 [7]). In 2018 the Norwegian Data Protection Authority issued  a report on Artificial Intelligence and Privacy (Datatilsynet, 2018 [8]). In December 2017 , the French Data  Protection Authority (CNIL) issued a report that identified  six main ethical issues, derive d several guiding  principles, and conclude d with practical policy recommendations  (CNIL, 2017 [9]).

National AI Governance approaches   Canada   In 2017, the Government of Canada a nnounced EUR 84 million (CAD 125 million) for a Pan -Canadian Artificial Intelligence  Strategy to retain and attract top academic talent, increase the number of post -graduate trainees and researchers in AI,  promote collaboration between Canada’s main centre s of AI expertise, and position Canada as a world -leading destination  for companies seeking to invest in AI and innovation. The government selected CIFAR (Canadian Institute for Advanced  Research), an independent, not -for-profit organisation that supports the advancement of science through international and  interdisciplinary collaboration and high -risk, high -impact research, as the organi sation responsible for its implementation.   Other initiatives include the ‘Innovation Supercluster Initiative’ which is pr oviding EUR 155 million (CAD 230 million) in funding  to the Scale AI Supercluster to bring together retail, manufacturing, transportation, infrastructure and information and  communications technology (ICT) sectors to build intelligent supply chains powered  by AI.    China   The State Council of China published its national AI strategy in July 2017 ( Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence Development  Plan). The strategy set the target of AI development in China, including becoming  a global AI innovation centre by 2030 and  building  up an AI industry of USD 150 billion (RMB 1 trillion). Following the strategy, the Chinese government launched pilot  AI projects called “National Pilot Areas for AI Innovative Development” to test the application of emerging technologi es, explore  effective policy tools and measure the social impact of technologies. The government is developing its 14th Five -Year Plan  (2021 -2025) that prioritises innovation and China’s long -term competitiveness in AI (Xia, 2021 [10]).  To cope with social challenges associated with the adoption of AI technologies, the government created an advisory committee  for AI governance in March 2019: the National Specialised Advisory Committee for AI Governance. The Committee published  AI governance principles (A New Generation of Artificial Intelligence Governance Principles) in June 2019. The AI governance  principles are: i) Harmony and Human -friendly, ii) Fairness and Justice, iii) Inclusion and Sharing, iv) Respect for Privacy, v)  Safety and Controllability, vi) Shared Responsibility, vii) Open and Collaboration, and viii) Agile Governance.

The purpose of this document was to identif y an  overall direction for AI -related work in Sweden and lay the foundation for future priorities. The document identified the direction  and priorities for AI -related work in Sweden: i) education and training ii) research, iii) innovation and use, and iv) a framework  and infrastructure. ONE AI member Irene Ek (Sweden) presented the AI -related governance structure in Sweden. Three  Ministries – Ministry of Infrastructure; Ministry of Enterprise and Innovation; and Ministry of Education and Research – are  responsible for AI policies and independent agencies under these Ministries implement these policies. For example:    The Ministry of Infrastructure oversees a project called ‘Data as a strategic resource in SME’ and Agency for Regional  Growth are implementing t he project.    The Ministry of Enterprise & Innovation set up a research grant and Vinnova (the Swedish innovation agency) is  allocating the grant.

28  STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES        OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  Countries and inter -governmental organisations are exploring different  regulatory frameworks to ensure trustworthy AI systems   Alongside promoting  the widespread  adoption of AI, national AI strategies call for responses to policy  concerns raised by AI applications. These concerns relate to human rights, privacy, fairness, algorithmi c  bias, transparency  and explainability, safety and accountability , among others . For example, safety  concerns are associated with  autonomous systems that control unmanned aircraft systems, driverless cars  and robots. With regards to fairness, there are concerns about potential bia ses in AI systems that impact  peoples’ job s, loans or health care.  From a human rights perspective, many strategies highlight concerns  over the impact on the right to privacy when it comes to the use of personal data in AI systems, and how  to ensure the right to an effective remedy when there has been a human rights violation involving AI  (Global  Partners Digital, 2021 [11]).    Policy makers across the world have recognised the regulatory challenges associated with digital  transformation, and have responded in a variety of ways, ranging from “wait an d see” to “test and learn”  to  banning digitally enabled business models outright (OECD, 2018 [12]). Countries are exploring approaches  to ensure trustworthy AI and mitigate risks associated  with the development and deployment of AI systems.   In addition to exploring the application and need to adapt current legislation for AI, emerging regulatory  actions for AI trustworthiness include: i) providing soft law guidance; i i) considering hard law approaches ,  iii) introducing application -specific moratoriums or bans; iv) promoting controlled environments for  regulatory experimentation and v) supporting international standardisation  efforts  and international  law  efforts .   Overall , countries ’ initiati ves still retain predominately “soft” regulat ory approaches  for AI, includ ing the  development of ethical frameworks and guidelines , voluntary processes, technical standards , and codes  of conduct . There is , however,  a trend towards the development  of legisl ative reforms and regulations for  specific application s.  As highlighted by ONE AI member Lord Tim Clement -Jones, 2020 saw work at the international level in  the  Council of Europe,  OECD  and EU to operationalise high -level ethical principles such as the OECD  AI  Principles, with predominantly  risk-based approaches to regulation (Clement -Jones, 2020 [13]): “When it  comes to AI technologies, we need to assess the risks such as the likely impact and probability of harm,  the importance and sensitivity of use of data, the application within a particular sector, the risk of non compliance and whether a human in the loop mitigates risk to any degree .” To help policy makers navigate  the complexity brought by the different policy concerns rai sed by different AI systems, t he OECD Network  of Experts Working Group on the Classification of AI systems is developing the OECD AI Systems  Classification Framework ( Box 5). 
STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES    29     OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  Box 5. OECD AI Sys tems Classification Framework   The OECD Classification Framework for AI systems seeks to provide a structure for assessing and classifying AI systems  according to their potential impact on public policy in areas covered by the OECD AI Principles. It is dev eloped by the OECD  Network of Experts on AI (ONE AI).   AI systems are classified along four dimensions:   1. The context in which the system operates (e.g., sector of application, breadth of deployment).   2. The data and input used by the system (e.g., quality, the privacy of data).   3. The AI model that underpins the system (e.g., generative or symbolic models); and   4. The task and output that the system produces (e.g., level of autonomy, nature of the output).     Source: OECD (forthcoming), for more information visit: https://oecd.ai/wonk/a -first-look-at-the-oecds -framework -for-the-classification -of-aisystems -for-policymakers   Soft law guidance    Many countries have introduced guidelines for trustworthy AI that are largely aligned with the OECD AI  Principles and that pr ovide standards for the ethical use of AI  and its governance. Depending on the case,  they are addressed to policy makers, businesses, research institutions and other AI actors. Example s  include  Australia’s AI Ethics Framework; Belgium’s online self -assessm ent tool to foster trustworthy AI  specifically tailored to  the public sector;  Colombia’s Ethics Framework for Artificial Intelligence, Egypt’s  Charter on Responsible AI  (under development  - planned to include assessment guidelines, technical  guidelines and  good  practices ); Hungary’s AI Ethical Guidelines ; Japan’s AI R&D Guidelines and AI  Utilisation Guidelines ; and Scotland’s AI explainability framework.    At the E U level, the European Commission’s independent AI High-Level Expert Group (AI HLEG)  introduced Ethical Guidelines on AI  in December 2018 . In July 2020, the AI HLEG presented a final  Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (European Commission, 2020 [14]).   Regulatory experimentation   Many countries are startin g to consider experimental models or co -regulatory approaches. These  approaches aim to allow experimentation to better understand the effects of AI systems and provide  controlled environments to facilitate the scale -up of new business models (OECD, 2019 [15]; Planes -Satorra  and Paunov, 2019 [16]). These take place in parallel to regulatory approaches that help create a policy  environment that supports the transition from research to deployment of trustwo rthy AI systems. The  concept of sandboxes was formally introduced in the United States. Subsequently, experimentation with  sandboxes was conducted by the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority. The objective of these  sandboxes was to test new Fintech  products and services before they officially enter the market. Since  then, a number of sandboxes have emerged in a broad range of sectors.   Hard law approaches   Regulators are actively investigating and discussing regulat ions on AI-related issues. The OECD  Parliamentary Group on Artificial Intelligence was formed in October 2019 to facilitate exchanges among  legislators . The group, which held its first meeting in February 2020 , also provide s educational, technical  and policy  guidance  to help inform national legislative processes.  
30  STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES        OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  As of January 2021, there are no mandatory governance instruments to regulate AI systems specifically .  However, several governments and intergovernmental bodies have adopted or are considering binding  legislation for specific areas of AI technolog ies. For example, the Danish R oad Directorate has issued a  binding guide on driverless cars. In June 2017, Germany allowed drivers to transfer control of vehicles to  highly or fully automated driving systems for use  on public roads. In the U nited States, the Federal Aviation  Administration has been rolling out new regulations, rulemakings and pilot programmes. These aim to  accelerate  the integration of unmanned aircraft systems into the national airspace system. In 2020, the US  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considered  regulating certain AI -powered medical diagnostic systems  (FDA, 2020[8]). In February 2020, New York City introduced a regulation on the ‘sale of automated  employment decision tools ’.  Outright / effective ban   An outright (or effective) ban can be implemented by governments to maintain the existing market   mechanisms or to protect citizens from the negative consequences of AI technologies . For example,  Belgium has adopted resolutions to prohibit the use of lethal autonomous weap ons by local armed forces.   Over the past years, biometric surveillance or facial recognition technology has emerged as a salient issue  of public debate . Risks of improper algorithmic bias and data privacy concerns  have  result ed in various  calls and action s to ban the use of facial recognition technology. In the United States,  both federal  and  state governments indicated a willingness to enact regulations on the use of facial recognition technology  by government agencies or law enforcement , as an innovative  policy and regulatory tool for improving  regulatory confidence over the  various harms and benefits generated by emerging  business  models and  technologies.   A selection of  AI regulatory approaches   Finland   Finland’s  Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Fina nce are currently examining national regulation on  automated decision -making. A preliminary assessment of regulatory needs was published in July 2020.  The main objectives of the process are i) to assess how automated decision -making within public  administr ation meets the requirements from the Constitution of Finland and the data protection legislation  of the European Union; and ii) to improve the regulatory environment and governance to encourage  digitali sation and sustainable development, as well as a broa d culture of experimentation.   Germany   In 2019, the German Data Ethics Commission assembled a regulatory risk pyramid for algorithmic systems,  assessing the severity of harm and the likelihood of harm (Daten Ethik Kommission, 2019 [4]).  This system  was then adopted as the basis for the European Commission’s White  Paper on A rtificial Intelligence.   In November 2020, the German AI Inquiry Committee ( Enquete -Kommission Künstliche Intelligenz des  Deutschen Bundestages ) presented its final report, which provides broad recommendations on how  society can benefit from the opportunities inherent in AI technologies while acknowledging the risks they  pose. The Committee’s work placed a focus on legal and ethical aspects of AI and its impact on the  economy, public administration, cybersecurity, health, work, mobility, and the media. The Committee  advocates for a “human -centric” approach to AI, a harmonious Europe -wide strategy, a focus on  interdisciplinary dialog ue in policymaking , setting tec hnical standards, legal clarity on testing of products  and research, and the adequacy of digital infrastructure.  
STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES    31     OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  New Zealand   In 2020, the New Zealand government launched a set of standards designed to act as a guideline for  government agencies on how to us e algorithms (the Algorithm Charter for Aotearoa New Zealand). The  charter has been signed by 26 agencies in the country. The algorithm charter continue s to evolve and will  be reviewed after it has been in place for  12 months to ensure it achieved its inte nded purpose without  stifling innovation or creating a compliance burden.   Portugal   The Portuguese AI strategy proposes  to i) create  an ethical committee for AI and automation to define and  deploy guidelines for ethical -by-design AI; and ii) support the dev elopment of a legal and regulatory  framework. This framework  aims to  determine issues related to liability in AI decision -making . Further more ,  the Portuguese government set up technological free zones . These zones focus on innovation and testing  emerging t echnologies like artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, big data, and 5G in real environments.  The project is part of the Portuguese government’s digital transition plan that is aimed at boosting social economic progress and facilitating the country’s t ransition to a sustainable economy.   Russia   In 2020, Russia adopted two laws in the area of digital innovation: i) the Federal Law on experimental legal  regimes for "regulatory sandboxes" in the field of digital innovation and  ii) the Federal Law on experim ental  regulation to facilitate  development and implementation of AI technologies in Moscow .  Russia is developing AI regulation in the fields of autonomous vehicles  and healthcare . In the area of  autonomous vehicles, the Russian Government issued a regulati on on highly automated vehicles on public  roads in 2018 to allow the testing of autonomous vehicles . In 2020, Russia adopted the concept of road  safety with autonomous vehicles on public roads and in 2021, the Russian government issued a set of  measures fo r the testing of highly automated vehicles on public roads. In the area of healthcare, Russia  established Rules for registering AI systems as medical software  devices  to simplify AI system  registration  procedures .   Singapore   In 2019, Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) launched the Model AI Governance  Framework as a living document that  puts AI ethics principles into implementable practices and measures.  In early 2020, IMDA launched the second edition of the framework.  It guides  private  sector organisations  on how to address  ethical and governance issues when deploying AI solutions. The second edition  highlights  that the framework is:    Algorithm -agnostic: does not focus on specific  methodologies related to AI or data analytics. It  applie s to the design, application and use of AI in general.    Technology -agnostic: does not focus on specific systems, software, or technology, and will be  applicable  regardless of the development language and data storage method .   Secto r-agnostic: serves as a bas eline set of considerations and measures  that can be adopted by  organisations operating in any sector. Specific sectors or organisations may choose to include  additional considerations and measure or adapt the framework  to meet their needs. IMDA   encourages  and will collaborate with public agencies adapting the Model Framework .   Scale - and business  model -agnostic: the framework  does not focus on organisations of a particular  scale or size. It can also be used by organisations engaging in business -to-business or business to-consumer activities and operations, or in any other business model . 
32  STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES        OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  United States    In November 2020, the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued guidance to federal agencies  on when and how to regulate the private sector use of AI. The OMB’s  guidance on AI rulemaking  includes  a “regulatory impact assessment.”  The guidance focused on a risk -based, cost -benefit approach to AI  regulation and prioritises non -regulatory approaches where possible . It requir es that federal agencies  develop compliance plans by 17 May 2021. Agenc ies will be obliged to document their regulatory authority   over “high -priority AI applications,” collections of “AI -related information” from regulated entities (and any  restrictions on the collection or sharing of suc h information), the outcomes of stakeholder engagement that  identify existing regulatory barriers to AI applications within that agency’s purview, and any planned  regulatory actions.    In December 2020, the US government signed a second Executive Order on A I, guiding  the adoption of  trustworthy AI by federal agencies  in a manner that protects the privacy and civil rights. The Executive  Order directs agencies to prepare inventories of AI  use cases throughout their departments by July 2021.   United Kingdom   In July 2020, the Information Commissioner’s Office (“ICO”) published Guidance on Artificial Intelligence   and Data Protection , to help organisations mitigate the risks of AI arising from a data protection  perspective. The guidance sets out a framework and a methodology for auditing AI systems . The guidance  includes  best practices for compliance with the UK Data Protection Act 2018 and with data protection  obligations under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The guidance’s “proportionate  and risk-based approach ” contains an auditing methodology with: i) tools and procedures for audits and  investigations; ii) detailed guidance on AI and data protection , and iii) a toolkit provid ing practical support  to organi sations auditing the compliance of t heir own AI systems. The guidance addresses: i) accountability  and governance in AI; ii) fair, lawful and transparent processing; iii) data minimi sation and security; and  iv) compliance with individual data subject rights.   The House of Lords’ Liaison Commi ttee published a report in December  2020  (UK House of Lords Liason  Committee, 2020 [17]) follow ing up on a 2018 House of Lords  (UK House of Lords, 2018 [18]). The House of  Lords’ 2020 Report found  individual industry regulators and actors  to be  well placed to establis h voluntary  mechanisms for informing the public when AI is being used for significant or sensitive decisions for  consumers  and tasked  the AI Council with develop ing and implement ing such mechanisms. The report  also flagged deficiencies in the existing legal framework for AI use in facial recognition applications ,  cautioning that a solely self-regulatory approach to ethical standards for AI would not be sufficient to ensure   public trust. Mor eover, the report recommended tha t by July 2021, the ICO  – with input from the CDEI, the  Office for AI and the Alan Turing Institute  – develop a training course for regulators on public data use and  AI. The report also recommended that CDEI  develop ed international standards for ethical AI development  by policy  makers and businesses.   In January 2021, the AI Council, an independent expert and industry committee advis ing the UK  Government on AI, published a roadmap recommend ing the deployment of a national AI strategy  in the  UK (UK AI Council, 2021 [19])). The roadmap stressed the UK should lead in developing appropriate  standards on data governance and enact “clear and flexible regulation” building on guidance from  regulators such a s the ICO. The roadmap noted that “ the public should be reassured that the use of AI is  safe, secure, fair, ethical and overseen by independent entities .” In addition to the continuous development  of industry standards and suitable regulations and framewor ks for algorithmic accountability, it mentioned  the need  for further legislation, such as a public interest data bill to ensure transparency of automated  decision -making, the right for people  to seek meaningful information (for example, through algorithmic   impact assessments) and the ability for regulators to enforce sanctions.  
STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES    33     OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  European Union  (EU)  In February  2020 , the European Commission  (EC) published a white paper on AI (European Commission,  2020 [20]). The paper consid ers requiring a pre -market conformity assessment for “high -risk” AI applications,  such as facial recognition, as a core element of a potential regulatory framework for AI. The paper also  considers documentation requirements that enable authorities to ensur e high -risk AI systems comply with  fundamental rights.  In addition, a voluntary “quality label” for AI applications deemed low -risk is mentioned.  The white paper  was followed by a public  consultation  in which  over 1200 stakeholders provid ed feedback  on the EC’s white paper, highlighting concern s about AI’s potential to breach fundamental rights  and lead  to discriminatory outcomes.   In July 2020, the EC published a preliminary  impact assessment for AI legislation (European Commission,  2020[8]) , outlining th at new legislation will focus on : i) protecting consumers from potential  harm caused  by AI, such as accidents caused by autonomous vehicles or other AI -driven robotics; ii) protecting  fundamental rights, including those that threaten  privacy and freedom of  expression , such as facial  recognition surveillance and similar monitoring systems; and iii) unlawful discrimination that may be caused  by AI tools displaying bias against certain populations.  The European Commission is expected to launch  its revised AI l egislative proposal in April 2021.    In December 2020 , the EC introduced two legislative proposals to the Council and the European  Parliament  – the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act  – that would  create new obligations and  responsibilities for  online  platforms  in terms of their access and processing of data , to ensure  that  recommendation algorithms are safe and transparent while promoting fair competition and fostering  innovation . Liability regulation is also under review.   On 21 April 2021, th e EC published its “AI legislative  package”  that comprises: i) a Proposal for a  Regulation on a European approach for Artificial Intelligence ( Box 6); ii) an updated Coordinated Plan with  Member States , and iii) a P roposal for a Re gulation on M achinery Products.   Box 6. European Commission’s legislative proposal on AI   In April 2021, the EC published a legislative proposal for a Coordinated European approach to address the human and ethical  implications of AI. The draft legislation follows a horizontal and risk -based regulatory approach that differentiates between  uses of AI that generate  i) minimal risk; ii) low risk; iii) high risk; and iv) unacceptable risk, for which the EC proposes a strict  ban. The EC legislative proposal requires that high -risk AI systems abide by a risk management system, be continuously  maintained and documented throughout their lifetime and enable interpretability of their outcomes and human oversight. The  proposal also e ncourages European countries to establish AI regulatory sandboxes to facilitate the development and testing  of innovative AI systems under strict regulatory oversight (European Commission, 2021 [21]).   The European Parliament for its part established a Special Committee on AI in a Digital Age  (AIDA) in  June 2020, which published reports on ethical aspects of AI, robotics and related technologies (European  Parliament, 2020[7])  and recommendations on AI civil liability regime s (European Parliament, 2020[8]).   The European Parliament adopted Guidelines for military and non -military use of AI to ensure its robust,  safe and secure use and respect of  human dignity and human rights in EU defence -related activities : it  says that h umans must exert meaningful control over AI systems and  be responsib le and accountab le for  their use.   Council of Europe    The Council of Europe and its bodies have  examin ed the impact of AI and publish ed a series of  recommendations. Examples include i) an ethical  charter on the use of AI in judicial systems (Council of  Europe, 2018 [22]), ii) guidelines on data protection and AI (Council of Europe, 2019 [23]) and facial recognition 
34  STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES        OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  in 2021 (Council of Europe, 2021 [24]); and  iii) a feasibility study report to develop Council’s instrument on  AI and criminal law (Council of Europe, 2020 [25]). In March 2021, the Council’s Committee of Ministers  adopted a dec laration on the risks of AI -enabled decision making in the field of the social safety net (Council  of Europe, 2021 [26]).   The Council of Europe’s Ad hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence (CAHAI) adopted  a Feasibility Study  on a legal framework for AI  in December 2020 (Council of Europe, 2020 [27]). The study examines the  viability  and potential elements of such a framework  for the development and deployment of AI, based on  the Council of Europe’s  standards  on human rights, democracy and the rule of law .   The study proposes the creation  of a new legal framework for AI consisting of both binding (such as a  convention) and non -binding Council of Europe instruments  and recommends a risk -based approach   targeting specific AI application contexts .  It identifies nine principles to respect human rights in the context  of AI: human dignity; prevention of harm to human rights, democracy and the rule of law; non discrimination, gender equality, fairness and di versity; the principle of transparency and explainability of AI  systems; data protection and the right to privacy; accountability and responsibility; democracy; and rule of  law. Concrete rights and obligations are associated  with each of these principles . These principles are  consistent with the OECD AI Principles .   Standards can help foster interoperable and trustworthy AI systems   Some countries are developing technical standard frameworks to support the implementation of the OECD  AI principles. Countries such as  Australia, Canada, China, Germany and the United States emphasise the  need for common standards, particularly with regards  to security issues. For example, Standards Australia  launched Australia’s AI Standards Roadmap in March 2020. The roadmap pro vides a framework for  Australians to shape the development of standards for AI internationally. It explores standards that can  promote and develop  the opportunities of responsible AI, delivering business growth, improving services  and protecting consumers  (Standards Australia, 2020 [28]).   In August 20 19, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)  published the report “ U.S.  Leadership in AI: A Plan for Federal Engagement in Developing Technical Standards and R elated Tools ”  which emphasises the importance of AI technical standards  for trustworthy AI (NIST, 2019 [29]). In August  2020, NIST  published a paper entitled ‘ Four Principles of Explainable Artificial Intelligence ’, compris ing  four fundamental properties for explainable AI systems (NIST, 2020 [30]):    Explanation : AI systems should deliver accompanying evidence or reasons for all their outputs.    Meaningful : AI systems should provide explanations that are  meaningful or understandable to  individual users.    Explanation Accuracy : The explanation should correctly reflect  the system’s process for generating  the output.    Knowledge Limits : The system should only operate under conditions for which it was designed or  when the system reaches sufficient confidence in its output.   In November 2020, Germany launched the German Standardization Roadmap on Artificial Intelligence  (DKE, 2020 [31]). The Roadmap provides an overview of the status qu o, requirements and challenges as  well as the need for standardi sation on seven key topics related to AI: basic principles, trustworthy AI,  quality, conformity assessment and certification, IT security in AI systems, industrial automation, mobility  and log istics and AI in medicine. The European political framework, European initiatives on AI and AI  strategies of other countries were taken into account in develop ing the Roadmap.   Several cross -sector (horizontal) and sector -specific (vertical) AI standards ar e under development or  becoming available, including those developed by organisations such as the International Organization for  Standardization  (ISO)  and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  (IEEE) . Countries, including 
STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES    35     OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  Denmark, Malta and  Sweden, plan to establish or have already established  AI certification programmes.  The Danish government, alongside the Confederation of Danish Industry, the Danish Chamber of  Commerce, SMEdenmark and the Danish Consumer Council, has created an independen t labelling  scheme: the Joint Cybersecurity and Data Ethics Seal  (Larsen, 2020[14]).  The seal is granted to  companies that meet requirements for cybersecurity and responsible handling of AI -related data .

Section 6 of this report discusses the state of international co -operation for  trustwort hy AI.   Promoting investments in AI R&D     Investing in AI research and development (Principle 2.1)   “Governments should consider long -term public investment, and encourage private  investment in research and development, including inter -disciplinary efforts, to spur  innovation in trustworthy AI that focus on challenging technical issues and on AI -related  social, legal and ethical implications and policy issues.   Governments should also consider public investment and encourage private investment in  open datasets  that are representative and respect privacy and data protection to support an  environment for AI research and development that is free of inappropriate bias and to  improve interope rability and use of standards.”   Enhancing AI R&D capabilities feature s in many national AI strategies , with  AI considered to be a  general purpose technology that can impact many  industries. It is an “invention of a method of invention”   (Cockburn, 2018 [32]) and widely used by scientists and inventors to  facilitate innovation , underscoring  the  importance of basic research and policies to consolidate research capability to catch up with the two  leading countries: the United States and China (Figure  8).   Scientific r esearch and AI   Over the past 20 years, AI publications continue to incr ease, led by the United States , China  and EU -27.  Figure  8 shows  the absolute number of scientific publications on AI by countr y using data from  Microsoft  Academic Graph . China has been rapid ly increasing  its scientific publications since the early 2000s. India’s  production of scientific publications has increased dramatically since 2010. When quality measure s are  factored in, p ublications from th e United States account for a majority of the top-ranked papers  (Figure  9).

38  STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES        OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  AI calls for policy makers to reconsider the appropriate level of government involvement in AI research to  address societal challenges, especially in promising areas underserved by market -driven investments. In  addition, research institutions in all area s require capable AI systems to remain competitive, particularly in  biomedical science and life science fields.  The Stanford Institute for Human -Centered Artificial Intelligence  2021 AI Index report outlined recent AI trends and developments in 2020. Among  their findings are  significant increases in private AI R&D, especially in the field of biotech and drug design (Stanford  University, 2021 [33]).  Public budgets on AI  R&D  vary across countries   Emerging trends on countries’ AI pub lic R&D investments include: i) supporting the establishment of  national AI research institutes; ii) consolidating AI research networks and collaborative platforms; iii)  prioritising AI investments in specific sectors; iv) pursuing AI mission -oriented inno vation policies; and v)  procuring AI systems for the public sector.   The allocation of public budgets on AI R&D varies in scale across countries. In many instances , the  distribution of budgets per year for AI R&D and other aspects of the strategy is not exp licitly mentioned.  While there are no official  or comparable estimates of public investment in non -defence AI R&D, several  budget elements are provided below. Further, budget figures, however, do not include substantial AI R&D  investments by national Defen ce bodies, as they are withheld  from publication for national security  reasons.  The OECD has begun to assess government spending on AI -related R&D, mostly through proxy  approaches, but to date , no comprehensive method exists by which to track and compare A I R&D funding  across countries and agencies (OECD, forthcoming [34]).  Public budgets on AI vary radically across countries (from over USD 2 billion in the US, around USD 1  billion in Japan, to around      USD  500 million in Kor ea, Spain  or the United Kingdom, to less than USD 1  million in Greece, Lithuania or Portugal)  per year . In China, the State Council released the Guideline on  Next Generation AI Development Plan in 2017. This  aims to achieve: i)  AI-driven economic growth in  China  by 2020; ii)   breakthroughs in basic theories by 2025 and in building an intelligent society; and iii)  for China  to be a global AI innovation centre by 2030 and to build up an AI industry of USD  150 billion ( RMB  1 trillion)  (China, 2017 [35]). Data on Chinese public investment in AI R&D are not readily available. However,  researchers at Georgetown’s Centre for Security and Emerging Technology estimated that public AI R&D  was in the order of a few billion US dollars in 2018,  similar to the planned spending of the United States  for FY2020. They also put forward that Chinese public AI R&D spending likely focuses on applied research  and experimental development rather than basic research (Acharya and Ar nold, 2019 [36]). Singapore  committed over EUR 326 million (SGD 500 million) to further AI research innovation and enterprise.   The European Commission has committed EUR 1.5 billion to AI research over two years as part of its  Horizon 2020 programme . The E uropean Union expects the private sector and its member states at the  national level to complement this investment, reaching at least EUR 20 billion invested by the end of 2020.  This includes EUR  20 million to build the European Network of AI Excellence Ce ntres (AI4EU), a European  online platform that allows the exchange of AI tools and resources. Funding through Horizon Europe and  the new Digital Europe Programme  aims to bring a digital transformation in the EU in the period 2021 2027, with maximum benefit s for businesses, public administrations and society. The policies of the Digital  Europe Programme  focus on five primary areas : high -performance computing (HPC); AI; cybersecurity  and trust; advanced digital skills; interoperability and digital transformat ion. Support for AI R&D also  includes grants to establish centres of excellence. The European Commission has planned an overall  budget of EUR 7.5 billion for 2021 -2027.  At least EUR 2.1 billion is expected to be allocated  exclusively  to  AI invest ment  and facilitating the use of  AI by businesses and public administrations; set ting up a European  Data Space and energy -efficient cloud infrastructure; and strengthen ing and support ing AI testing and  experimentation in areas such as health and mobility in member s tates  (European Commission, 2021 [37]). 
STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES    39     OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  At the national level  in Europe , Denmark  allocated EUR  27 million ( DKK 215 million ) of its 2019 State  Budget to the Innovation Fund Denmark to research technological possibilities offered  by AI. The  Finnish  Centre for AI, a nationwide competence centre for AI with Academy of Finland flagship status, has been  allocated EUR  250 million funding for the next eight years.  In 2020, Germany increased its fund ing for AI  from EUR 3 billion to EUR 5 billion  until 2025  (BMBF, 2020 [38]). In late 2020, Spain adopted  its National  Artificial Intelligence Strategy  and plans to invest EUR 600 million in AI over 2021 -2023 , and attract private  funding of EUR 3.3 billion through p ublic-private initiatives.   Establishing national AI research institutes   Some  countries have established AI centres of excellence to strengthen AI research capabilities  and to  create interdisciplinary research communities.  Some AI strategies  call for the e stablishment of  AI hubs,  research centers that will help with R&D efforts as they relate to AI.    Canada is funding AI research institutes in Montreal, Toronto, and Edmonton  to bring academic  talent to Canada. These hubs and institutes facilitate connection s within  the AI ecosystem and help  cataly se partnerships  and initiative s. Canada’s federal and provincial governments have dedicated  over USD 227 million ( CAD 300 million) to AI research over 2017 - 22, anchored in the three AI  institutes along with the CIFAR Pan-Canadian AI Strategy.    In the United States, the National Science Foundation (NSF) is investing in both foundational and  translational AI research and is creat ing National AI Research Institutes in collaboration with the  departments of Agriculture, Homeland Security, and Transportation  (Figure  10). The objective is to  trigger  multisector  and multidisciplinary research and workforce training . In 2021 -2022, the NSF  program me invites  proposals from research institutions that focus on: i) Human -AI Interaction and  Collaboration; ii) AI Institute for Advances in Optimi sation; iii) AI and Advanced Cyberinfrastructure;  iv) Advances in AI and Computer and Network Systems ; v) AI Institute in Dynamic Systems; vi) AI Augme nted Learning; v ii) AI to Advance Biology; viii) AI -Driven Innovation in Agriculture and the  Food System . The 2020 National AI Initiative Act of 2020 budget authori ses nearly USD 4.79 billion   in funding for AI research at the National Science Foundation  over the next five years, USD 1.15  billion at the DoE, and USD 390 million at NIST . Further,  a report from the US National Security  Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) launched in March 2021, calls for the allocation of at  least USD 8 billion towar ds AI R&D annually (NSCAI, 2021 [39]).

Each institute has been given areas of focus : MIAI in Grenoble  focus es on health , environment and energy.  3IA Côte d’Azur in Nice focuses on health and the  development of the territories.  The PRAIRIE institute  in Paris  focuses  on health, transport and the  environment.  The ANITI in Toulouse focuses  on trans port, the environment and health.  It is  reported that EUR 225 million will be spent on 3IA research projects  in total .10   Consolidating AI research networks and centres of excellence   As part of Germany’s AI strategy, the government developed a Network of  AI Research Competence  Centres  to increase research capability by involving 26 existing institutions.  These centres, located in  Munich, Tübingen, Berlin, Dortmund, Saarbrucken, and Dresden, plan to develop an interconnected  network ( Figure  11) for which government funding will double by 2022. These centres are complemented  by application hubs  that support SMEs adopting AI technologies. ONE AI member Andreas Hartl  (Germany) noted that this approach reflected the recomme ndation from stakeholders to leverage current  research institutions rather than creating new AI -specific institution.  He also  highlighted an initiative entitled  ‘AI Coach ’, in which competence centres provide seminars for SMEs. He noted that more than 50 c oaches  were active in 2019 (BMBF, 2020 [38]).

Japan has also established the “AI Japan R&D Network” in 2019 to facilitate exchange and collaboration  among AI researchers from over 100 universities and institutes ( Figure  12). Three national  institutes – the  National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), the Institute of Physical and  Chemical Research (RIKEN) and the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology  (NICT) – play a key role in AI resear ch. Other member organisations bring specific expertise to advance  AI research in Japan.     Figure  12. AI Japan R&D Network     Source: Presentation by ONE AI member Yoichi Iida (Japan), 19 January 2021, ( Expert  group 7th Meeting).      In the United Kingdom, the AI Council recommended i n its 2021 AI Roadma p to expand the role of the  Alan Turing Institute to become a national network of hubs or centres of excellence. In turn, the centres of  excellence would provide research, training, ap prenticeships and upskilling (UK AI Council, 2021 [19]).  Prioritising AI investments in strategic sectors   A substantial number of national AI strategies and policies outline how countries plan to invest in AI to build  or levera ge their comparative advantages. They also  encourage businesses to develop solutions that will  boost growth and well -being. Countries tend to prioritise a handful of economic sectors, including mobility  – logistics and transportation – and health ( Table  2). In mobility, AI applications can help governments  improve road safety, enhance  public transportation efficiency, manage traffic  and reduce carbon

In health care, AI can help governments harness the late st breakthroughs to help detect health  conditions early or remotely. They can also help deliver preventative services, optimise clinical decision making and discover new treatments and medications (OECD, 2020 [40]).   Table  2.

AI promises to make government services “smarter”: more agile, efficient and user -friendly . For instance,  AI can help deliver personalised services to citizens. It can also enhanc e the efficiency  and quality of  administrative procedures by automating physical and digital tasks. In addition, it can improve decisions  through better predictions based on patterns in large volumes of data (Ubaldi et  al., 2019 [41]).  Pursuing AI mission -oriented innovation policies   Mission -oriented innovation policies are a new type of systemic intervention that a growing number of  countries are implementing to tackle societal challenges  (Larrue, 2021 [42]). Some seek to leverage AI to  pursue grand challenges or “moon -shot” projects addressing high -impact societal challenges, such as  climate change, ageing populations, health, inclusiveness, food, energy and environmental insecurity , and  other objectives set out in the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. For example,  in January 2021, the UK’s AI Council recommended the government pursue “moon -shots (…) challenge led, high -risk, scalable programmes, both advancing  and leveraging AI (…) to tackle fundamental 
STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES    43     OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  challenges such as creating ‘explainable AI’, or important goals in any area where AI can contribute  strongly, such as the UK Digital Twin program or developing smart materials for energy storage in the  move tow ards net zero carbon emissions” (UK AI Council, 2021 [19]). In February 2021 the UK launched the  Advanced Research and Invention Agency (ARIA), based on successful models in other countries notably  the US Advanced Research Proje cts Agency (ARPA).   AI in the public sector   Building on their digital government approaches, many national AI strategies and policies explicitly  encourage the adoption of AI in the public sector. For example, the EU Coordinated Plan on AI plans to  “make pu blic administrations in Europe frontrunners in the use of AI.” Denmark aims for the public sector  to “use AI to offer world -class services for the benefit of citizens and society.” Finland’s Aurora AI project   aims to use AI to provide personalised, one -stop-shop and human -centric AI -driven public services. Public  entities can also use AI to strengthen law enforcement capabilities and to improve policy implementation.  AI is also expected to free up public servants’ time and allow them to shift to higher -value work (Berryhill  et al., 2019 [43]).  At the same time, the use of AI in the public sector present challenges, as public  administrations must ensure a high standard of transparency and accountability for their actions,  especially  those that directly impact individuals.   Despite these potential benefits, it has been argued that the role of the government as a user of AI  technology is often overshadowed by the role of the government as a facilitator for AI development or a s  a regulator to minimise negative consequences of AI (Misuraca & van Noordt, 2020) . AI in the public sector  raises questions ab out both regulating its use and leveraging it  to help in regulation and governance  processes.   To stimulate the use of AI in the public sector, governments employ  a variety of different policy actions that  range from improving the quality and accessibility  of internal datasets and providing training programmes  for civil servants on AI, to funding AI projects and to promoting AI regulation (Noordt et al., 2020) . For  example, Estonia established an Open Data Portal to give everyon e access to internal datasets and open  data. The Maltese government has proposed to hold various awareness campaigns for civil servants to  help them understand the potential of AI, allowing frontline staff to discover potential use cases for AI in  their wo rk. In Turkey, an open da ta portal was established to share data produced by citizens, researchers,   public institutions and organis ations, and state affiliates.    Stimulating the uptake of AI to provide better public services requires training: for example,  Canada is  developing foundational AI training which will be available to all federal public servants through the Canada  School of Public Service’s Digital Academy. The Danish government also plans to establish an internal  academy that provides AI training  to its staff specialist and generalist training programmes.   Many national AI strategies highlight ecosystems to use AI in the public sector (GovTech) and harness  local data ecosystems and talents.  For example:     Colombia has prioritised the support to pub lic entities in the adoption of GovtTech solutions.    Estonia published in February 2020 #KrattAI, an interoperable network of AI applications, which  will enable citizens to use public services with virtual assistants through voice -based interaction.  #Kratt AI is a network of both public and private sector AI solutions, which, from the user's point of  view, act as a single channel for public services and information.    Hungary’s AI strategy has a general goal of introduc ing data wallets and personalised data s ervices  to give citizens full control over their data, so they can decide who has access to their data, and  what they are can  do with the data, including the opportunity of directly profiting from such usage.    The United Arab Emirates launched an AI Lab le d by Smart Dubai in 2017.  The lab is testing use  cases across all types of city services – from police and security to land development, education  and the environment.  
44  STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES        OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS   The United States established an AI Center of Excellence to enable Federal Agencies to  determine  best practices for incorporating AI into their organisations (Parker, 2020 [44]).   To track how algorithms are deployed in cities, both Amsterdam and Helsinki have launched AI registers.  The registers currently contai n only a limited selection of applications. Helsinki’s is comprised of four  chatbots and an intelligent management system for the city library’s collection, while Amsterdam’s includes  an automated parking control system that analyses reports on issues in p ublic space with an AI system  calculating the probability of a vacation rental being illegal.   Procuring AI for the public sector   Administrations are, however, struggling with procuring and using innovative solutions from the private  sector as traditional public procurement processes may not be fit for the iterative process of developing AI  solutions. Some national government policies plan to revise existing procurement processes and  implement new, challenge -based procurement models to encourage trustworthy  AI in the public sector.   For example, Canada presented the Directive on Automated Decision -Making Systems  published by the  Treasury Board Secretariat and the Pre-qualified AI Vendor Procurement Program to ensure the  accountability of AI tools used within  the government.12 In 2020, the UK introduced the Guidelines on Public  Procurement  (Box 7). This recent development from the UK Government adds to the growing set of  guidance on the use of AI for the public sector. Other examples of su ch guidance include Guide to using  AI for the Public Sector  (2019); Data Ethics Framework  (updated in 2020); Code of conduct for data -driven  health and care technology (2018), and A Buyer’s Checklist for AI in Health and Care (2020); and ICO’s  AI Auditing Framework (2020) . The ICO’s work has a much broader application than just the public sector,  as it is aimed at any organisation seeking to adopt AI solutions.     
STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES    45     OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  Box 7. Policies to ensure the procurement of trustworthy AI in the Public  Sector   Canada   Canada’s Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) developed a whitepaper entitled ‘Responsible AI in the Government of Canada’  in 2018. This paper, produced with stakeholders through online and in -person consultations, highlighted the need for ove rsight  regarding the government’s use of AI systems. The TBS developed the Directive on Automated Decision -Making as a first  policy approach for AI. The cornerstone of the Directive is an Algorithmic Impact Assessment  to calculate the risks of an AI  system . In a parallel effort to support the Directive, TBS worked with Public Services and Procurement Canada to establish a  Pre-qualified AI Vendor Procurement Program  to streamline the procurement of AI solutions and services in the government.  Over 90 compani es are currently pre -qualified to provide AI services and solutions to the government under this programme.   ONE AI member Ashley Casovan (AI Global) provided her views on the challenges she sees for the government of Canada  in implementing the Pre -qualifi ed AI Vendor Procurement Program. This new AI public procurement programme was used to  help government departments and agencies build awareness of the solutions offered by AI. It also provided small and medium  AI companies with an opportunity to provide th eir services to the government. In practice, the initiative did not yet gain traction.  Ms Casovan underlined that if a new AI procurement programme is not mandatory, it is unlikely to be used by governmental  agencies. She also stressed that a complex procu rement process hindered adoption and that the new AI public programme  should be aligned with and complement existing procurement  practices to facilitate its use. She suggested the need for further  discussion on how AI procurement differs from other technol ogy procurement and why it requires ethical oversight as well as  clear guidance on the types of AI systems that should or not be subject to the procurement mechanism. For example,  exceptions could be made for certain systems that cannot  harm humans. She al so suggested that it is critical to formulate the  primary objective(s) of the procurement policy clearly, which should be to help departments and agencies obtain the solutions   and services they need.   Canada’s AI procurement programme is rich in lessons le arned and demonstrates the importance of embedding new AI  policies into existing governance structures.

More information at:  https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital -government/digital -government -innovations/responsible -use-ai.html   United Kingdom   In June 2020, the UK Government in collaboration with the World Economic Forum (WEF) published the Guidelines for Artificial  Intelligence (AI) procurement  that provide the centr al government and other public sector bodies with guiding principles for  purchasing AI technology. They also guide  challenges that may occur during the procurement process. In connection with this  project, the Office for AI and the WEF also created the AI Procurement in a Box toolkit, which acts as a guide for public sector  AI procurement.   The Guidelines set out the following top 10 considerations:   1. Include procurement within a strategy for AI adoption.   2. Make decisions in a diverse multidisciplinary team to mitigate AI bias.   3. Conduct a data assessment before starting the procurement process.   4. Assess the benefits and risks of AI deployment, including defining the public benefit goal.   5. Engage effectively with AI suppliers from the outset.   6. Establish the right route  to market and focus on the challenge rather than a specific solution.   7. Develop a plan for governance and information assurance.   8. Avoid ‘black box’ algorithms and vendor lock -in.    9. Focus on the need to address technical and ethical limitations of AI deployme nt during the evaluation.   10. Consider the lifecycle management of the AI system.

Such an ecosystem includes in particular digital technologies and  infrastructure, and mechanisms for sharing AI knowledge, as appropriate. In this regard,  governments should consider promoting mechanisms, such as data trusts, to support the  safe, fair, legal and ethical sharing of data” .  Countries increasingly link data access and sharing policies with AI policies   Many countries focus on providing access to public sector data, including open government data, geo -data  (e.g.,  maps) and transportation data. They also emphasise data sharing within the public sector. Countrie s  are building on their open data access policies and strategies to promote data access and sharing for AI.   For example, Denmark plans to provide open access to weather, climate and marine data from the Danish  Meteorological Institute, in addition to cop -operating with Europe’s space data.  In  Korea, the Ministry of  Science and ICT established the AI Open Innovation Hub  to provide supports for AI development and   promotion  (Figure  13).  Figure  13.

STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES    47     OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  Several national AI policies plan to develop centralised, accessible repositories of open public data. The  OECD 2019 Digital Government Index (OECD, 2019 [45]) assesses the maturity level of digital government  strategies in OECD countries  and partner economies based on the Survey of Digital Government. The  Index found that all respondents have a portal for open government data and th at most (82%) have an  action plan on open government data. In addition, 88% of respondents require openness by default.   In Norway, the Brønnøysund Register Centre and the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency have established  a national directory of data held by  different public agencies, their relationships, what they mean and  whether data can be shared and on what terms. Portugal also plans to create a centralised repository for  administrative data.   The U.K. is making available high -quality public data in an o pen, reusable and accessible format for  machine learning. The UK’s Geospatial Commission  aims to improve access to geospatial data, including  for AI uses. In 2018, t he U.K’s Office for AI, with the Open Data Institute and Innovate the UK, launched  three pilot projects to explore data trust  frameworks for safe, secure and equitable dat a transfers. In its AI  Roadma p, the AI Council recommended new policies and regulations beyond the National Data Strategy,  including a ‘Public Interest Data Bill’ and other standards and regulations aiming to position the UK as a  world leader in accessing and using ‘safe, secure a nd good quality data’  (UK AI Council, 2021 [19]).   Organisations focused on data have also been created or are being considered. The Spanish AI strategy,  for example, recommends the creation of a National Data Institute. Chile e stablished the Data Observatory   through a public -private  partnership in 2019 to provide open access to astronomical and environmental  data for the global scientific community, private industry, and the public. Hungary established the National  Data Agency ( NAVÜ) to enable efficient use of public data and provide analyses of public data. NAVÜ’s  tasks will include: i) operating a national public data portal, ii) setting up and managing a national public  data cadastre, iii) processing and analysing anonymised d atabases, and iv) offering data analysis services  to the government, markets and citizens.   Countries and regional institutions are encouraging both public and private sector data sharing. The  European Union will be creating a number  of European Data Space s, which will facilitate the sharing of  public and private sector data in a trusted environment ( Figure  15). ONE AI member Andreas Hartl  (Germany) noted that GAIA -X partners are not just from European countries; the  initiative also involves  partners from the United States and Japan.

Through its Digital New Deal , Korea is establishing a big data platform entitled Data Dam  to collect and  process both public and private data ( Figure  15. ). More than 2000 org anisations were engaged in the  development of this platform to integrate existing big data platforms help promote the digital transformation  of key industries in Korea.

Korea’s Data Dam     Source: Presentation by ONE AI member Deuk Jung Kim (Korea), 19 January 2021, ( Expert  group 7th Meeting) .  In February 2020, the European Commission launched the EU Data Strategy,  alongside its White Paper  on AI,  as the first pillar of the EC’s new digital strategy  (European Commission, 2020 [46]). The European  Commission's Data Str ategy envisions a common European Data Space , i.e., a single market for data that  can be used irrespective of its physical location in the EU, in compliance with applicable laws. It calls for a  mechanism for free and safe cross -border data flows, subject t o restrictions for public security, public order  and other legitimate EU public policy objectives.    In November 2020, the EC published its draft Data Governance Act . The first action of the EU Data  Strategy  promotes access to and sharing of data by encoura ging public data sharing  and allowing citizens  to donate their data to European Data Spaces (European Commission, 2020 [47]).   The OECD Committee on Digital Economy Policy (CDEP), through its Working Party on Data Governance  and Privacy, and together with the Committee for Scientific and Technological Policy and Public  Governance Committee, is currently developing a Recommendation on Enhancing Access to and Sharing  of Data (Box 8) (OECD, 2019 [48]).  
50  STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES        OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  Box 8. OECD project on enhancing access to and sharing of data (EASD)   The OECD has extensively analysed how enhancing access to data can maximise the social and economic value of data. The  November 2019 report " Enhancing Access to and Sharing of Data: Reconciling Risks and Benefits for Data Re -use across  Societies " identifies best practices to balance different interests to reap the benefits of data  access and sharing, while  managing and reducing risk to a socially acceptable level.   Towards general principles on EASD   The OECD is working towards general principles for enhancing access to and sharing of data across the economy in a  coherent manner and  consolidate guidance and best practices on issues such as data openness, transparency, stakeholder  engagement, intellectual property rights (IPR), and pricing. These legal instruments include:    OECD (2006, updated in 2021) Recommendation of the Council con cerning Access to Research Data from Public  Funding    OECD (2008) Recommendation of the Council for Enhanced Access and More Effective Use of Public Sector  Information    OECD (2014) Recommendation of the Council on Digital Government Strategies    OECD (2016) Rec ommendation of the Council on Health Data Governance     Note: More information on legal instruments available at https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/.   Source: https://www.oecd.org/sti /ieconomy/enhanced -data-access.htm    Uptake also requires access to AI technologies and computing capacity   Developing and using AI requires access to AI technologies and infrastructure. This requires affordable  high-speed broadband networks and services, computing power and data storage, as well as supporting  data-generating technology such as Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure. Improving connectivity will  enable innovative business models in many sectors such as manufacturing, healthcare, security,  transportation, education, and the development of smart cities.   Many countries have begun to deploy a 5G network to ensure high -quality connectivity that will also support  AI development and use. The United Kingdom’s AI strategy mentions a public investmen t of USD 1.24  billion ( GBP  1 billion) to boost digital infrastructure, including USD 219 million ( GPB 176 million) for 5G  and USD 249 million ( GBP 200 million) for full -fibre networks.  ONE AI member Deuk Jung Kim (Korea)  noted that integrating 5G and AI i nto industries and government services are priorities of the Korean New  Deal, a policy package launched in 2020 to facilitate structural changes and stimulate the country’s  recovery from the pandemic.   Many technical/software tools to develop AI systems ex ist as open -source resources, which facilitates their  adoption and allows for crowdsourcing solutions to software bugs on platforms such as Github. Some  researchers and companies share curated training datasets and training tools publicly to help diffuse A I  technology. In Estonia, the Open -source AI components initiative makes AI components available for reuse  by interested parties. The initiative allows both public and private sectors to reuse and further develop AI  solutions free  of charge. Under t he init iative , open -source tools for speech recognition, speech synthesis,  text keyword extraction, and chatbot solutions are available  to accelerate AI uptake.   Algorithms and data play strong roles in the development and performance of AI systems. However, as AI   projects move from concept to commercial application, they often need specialised and expensive cloud  computing and graphic -processing unit resources. Several countries allocate high -performance and cloud

Some are setting up  supercomputers designed for AI use and devoted to research and/or providing financial support to develop  the national high -performance  computing infrastructure. The ONE AI task force on AI  compute  (forthcoming) will develop a framework for understanding, measuring and benchmarking domestic AI  computing supply by country and region ( Box 9).   The European High -Performance Computing Joint Undertaking  (EuroHPC)  is a EUR  1 billion  undertaking by the European Union and several individual European countries. It aims to develop  peta and pre -exa-scale supercomputing capacities and data infrastructure to support European  scientific and industrial research and in novation.    In Japan, the RIKEN Cent er for Computational Science  and Fujitsu launched a top -ranked  Supercomputer named Fugaku in 2020 . The National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and  Technology (AIST) developed and operates an open AI computing in frastructure named AI  Bridging Cloud Infrastructure  to accelerate collaborative  AI R&D between  industr y, academia and  the government.    The Korean government launched the AI Semiconductor Industry Development Strategy  with USD  1 billion cross -ministerial R&D  project in 2020. The Korean government is also focusing on  providing a high -performance computing environment for companies, universities and research  institutions to enhance the adoption and use of AI technologies.    The US Department of Energy is building  the Frontier supercomputer , expected to debut in 2021  as the world’s most powerful high -performance computer for AI and the NSF  also invests  significantly in next -generation supercomputers  for AI R&D such as Frontera . The National  Aeronautics and Space Administration also has a high -end computing programme and is  augmenting its  Pleiades supercomputer  with new nodes specifically designed for machine learning  AI workloads (US, 2019 [49]). The US National AI Initiative Act of 2020 plans to make  world -class  computational resources  and datasets available to researchers across the country on the  forthcoming US National AI Research Resource Cloud  (NITRD, 2020 [50]).    In October 2020, the United Kingdom announced the upcoming launch of the UK’s most powerful   supercomputer, NVIDIA’s Cambridge -1 that will be used by healthcare researchers to tackle  pressing medical challenges.

ONE AI task force on AI compute   Alongside data and algorithms, AI computing capacity (“AI compute”) has eme rged over recent years as a key enabler for AI  and AI -enabled economic growth and competitiveness. While data and machine learning algorithms are receiving significant  attention in policy circles at the OECD and beyond, the computational infrastructure tha t makes AI possible has been  comparatively overlooked.  Since understanding domestic AI compute capacity is increasingly critical to formulating effective   AI policies and informing national AI investments, the CDEP and its ONE AI expert group are focusing on this area in 2021.   AI Enablers     The OECD AI Principles recommends that policy makers: “foster the development of, and access to […] digital technologies  and infrastructure” and also instruct the OECD Committee on Digital Economy Policy (CDEP): “to con tinue its important work  on AI building on this Recommendation […] to further develop the measurement framework for evidence -based AI policies.”   The creation of a ONE AI task force on AI compute in early 2021 will help the OECD create a framework for unde rstanding,  measuring and benchmarking domestic AI computing supply by country and region. The task force will coordinate the broad  engagement of key AI compute players and a data-gathering exercise that ideally would be sustainable over time. This task  force will also need to be mindful that the AI compute landscape is unusually dynamic with technology shifts frequently .   An interactive visualisation on the OECD.AI Policy Observatory is expected to feature the work of the task force.   The targeted focus of the ONE AI task force on AI compute will complement the activities of the three ONE AI working groups,  notably the working group on  national AI policies .  Countries are investing in language technologies   Language technologies (LTs) cover many AI discipline s, including natural language processing (NLP),  information extraction, speech recognition, computational linguistics and machine translation. A number of  countries prioritised LTs in their AI strategies as key to enabling interactive dialogue systems and personal  virtual assistants for personalised public services  (OECD, forthcoming [51]). Automated translation services  could mitigate language barriers in international e -commerce, particularly for SMEs (OECD, forthcoming   [16]). Some countries are consolidating datasets to create resources to train LT systems (Berryhill et  al.,  2019 [43]).   As part of its Digital Agenda , Spain announced a dedicated national plan ( National Plan for the  Advancemen t of Language Technologies )13 to foster LT development aiming to i) develop language  infrastructure (e.g., language processors) between Spanish and other official languages in Spain  (Catalan, Basque and Galician); ii) enhance the visibility of the Spanish L T sector and harness the  high potential  in the Ibero -American market;  iii) apply LTs in specific public services with high social  impact.    Denmark is focusing on LT to support ‘ AI in Danish ’ and in June 2020, launched a platform  displaying metadata of exis ting linguistic resources14 to facilitate the development of LTs in Danish  (sprogteknologi.dk) .

The system was developed by the National  Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT). In 2020, the Japanese  government announced the ‘ Global Communication Plan 2025 ’, which sets development targets  for LTs by 2025, including liaison inter pretation systems and LT applications to help foreign  visitors.15 ONE AI member Yoichi Iida (Japan) presented an LT application for natural disaster  response being leveraged by NICT to aggregate Twitter posts and display real time information on  recovery of  utilities, delivery of disaster relief supplies etc.     In Israel , the AI R&D Framework and Activities of the Innovation Authority is supporting the  development of Hebrew -language NLP tools.    In Turkey, under  the Turkish Natural Language Processing Project , the Ministry of Industry and  Technology plans to i) develop  user-friendly and high -performance libraries and datasets for  processing Turkish texts and ii) establish a distribution infrastructure for data and tools .   Shaping an enabling environment for AI   Shaping an enabling policy environment for AI (OECD AI Principle 2.3)   “Governments should promote a policy environment that supports an agile transition from  the research and development stage to the deployment and operation stage for trustworthy  AI system s. To this effect, they should consider using experimentation to provide a controlled  environment in which AI systems can be tested, and scaled  up, as appropriate.   Governments should review and adapt, as appropriate, their policy and regulatory  frameworks and assessment mechanisms as they apply to AI systems to encourage  innovation and competition for trustworthy AI.”   Countries seek to support an agile transition from R&D to commercialisation or deployment of AI in four  ways by i) providing controlled envir onments for experimentation and testing of AI systems; ii) improving  access of companies – including SMEs and start -ups – to funding; iii) connecting emerging companies  with business opportunities through networking and collaborative platforms , and iv) pro viding tailored  advisory to support businesses’ scale -up. A number of firms and service offerings such as DataRobot,  Amazon Web Services (AWS), Github, Kaggle, Google Tensorflow, and related services are also helping  to reduce barriers to AI adoption by sm all firms.16  Controlled environments for AI experimentation   Controlled environments for AI experimentation and testing facilitate the timely identification of potential  technical flaws and governance challenges.17 They  can reveal potential public concerns t hrough testing  under quasi real -world conditions (European Commission, 2020 [20]) and provide an impact assessment of  AI technology on various aspects of people’s lives, such as jobs, education and the environment.18 Such  environments include innovation centres, policy labs and regulatory sandboxes. The latter is a form  of  limited regulatory testing for innovative applications not intended to enable permanent regulatory waivers  or exemptions . Experiments can operate in “star t-up mode” whereby they are deployed, evaluated and  modified, and then scaled up or down, or abandoned quickly. Co -creation governance models engaging 
54  STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES        OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  both governments and  private stakeholders already play a key role in many national AI strategies, such as   those of Germany, New Zealand, Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States.    Colombia designed regulatory sandboxes and “beaches” (allowing for less oversight and more  flexibility for experimentation) for AI planned to be implemented in 2021  (DAPRE, 2020 [52]). In  November 2020, the Presidency of the Republic and the Data Protection Authority launched public  consultations on a regulatory sandbox on the ‘AI and Privacy by Design Principles’ (SIC, 20 20[53]).   Germany’s AI strategy plans the establishment of AI living labs and testbeds, such as the living lab  on the “ A9 autobahn ”. These allow the testing of technologies in real -life settings (Germany,  2018 [54]). ONE AI mem ber Andreas Hartl (Germany) noted that experimentation can help  companies adopt AI and allow the government to identify needed regulatory reforms. Germany is  facilitating experimentation by i) creating a network of regulatory sandboxes with over 520  partic ipants, ii) providing a Handbook for regulatory sandboxes  (BMWi, 2019 [55]), and iii) organising  a competition for regulatory sandboxes and highlighting innovative practices.    The Korean Ministry of Science and ICT, Ministry of T rade, Industry and Energy, Ministry of SMEs  and Startups established a regulatory sandbox in 2019 that grants a time -limited regulatory waiver  to businesses to test innovative products, services and business models. The sandbox also informs  government regu lations based on real -life data. The Korean Ministry of Science and ICT launched  the 7 AI+X projects  in collaboration with other ministries that use validation Labs to solve problems  in the military, security, customs, energy, defence, and industry ( Figure  16).   Figure  16. AI+X Project in Korea     Source: Presentation by ONE AI member Deuk Jung Kim (Korea), 19 January 2021, ( Expert  group 7th Meeting).    In Russia, the Federal Law on experimental  legal regimes seek s to establish regulatory sandboxes  to facilitate digital innovation. Additional regulations include a Federal law on  experimental  regulation to facilitate the development and implementation of AI technologies in Moscow and  regulation fo r test ing highly aut omated vehicles on public roads .   The United Arab Emirates announced in 2019 a collaboration between the regulatory lab (RegLab  of the UAE government) and the Dubai ‘10X’ regulatory sandbox (of the Dubai Future Foundation)  to provide a s afe experimental environment for future technologies including AI and inform  legislation (UAE Regulations Lab, 2020 [56]).    The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority established the world’s first regulatory sandbox  in 201 5. The sandbox seeks to provide financial firms with a) the ability to test products and  services in a controlled environment; b) reduced time -to-market at potentially lower costs; c)  support in identifying appropriate consumer protection safeguards to bui ld into new products and  
STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES    55     OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  services; and d) better access to finance (FCA, 2021 [57]). This model has been replicated in more  than 50 countries (BIS, 2020 [58]). In 2020, the FCA partnered with The Ala n Turing Institute to better  understand the practical challenges of AI transparency and explainability in the financial sector.    The European Commission is considering the development of large -scale AI testing and  experimentation facilities, which will be a vailable  to all actors across Europe to help avoid  duplication of efforts.  These testing facilities may include regulatory sandboxes in selected areas  (European Commission, 2020 [59]). The updated Coordinated Plan also encourages European  countries to establish AI regulatory sandboxes to facilitate the development and testing of  innovative AI systems under strict regulatory oversight (European Commission, 2021 [21]).  Financial incentives and access to f unding for companies   To spur investment in AI projects, some countries have created financial incentives. Since  January 2018,  the United Kingdom provided an AI R&D Expenditure Credit  (12% tax credit) to stimulate AI uptake,  including within the public sect or. In its AI Roadmap , the UK’s AI Council recommended improving funding  for high -growth AI start -ups to enable businesses to receive foreign investment while remaining in the UK  and focusing notably on series B+ funding (UK AI C ouncil, 2021 [19]). Malta has also reformed the Seed  Investments Scheme  with more favourable tax credit conditions for innovative AI firms.    Networking and collaborative platforms   Countries also develop innovative AI research ecosystems by establishing n etworking and collaborative  platforms, such as  AI hubs, AI labs and AI accelerator programmes. These facilitate cooperation between  industry, academia and public research institutes.    Canada’s Innovation Superclusters Initiative  invites industry -led consor tia to invest in regional  innovation ecosystems and supports partnerships between large firms, SMEs and industry relevant research institutions.    Denmark’s national AI strategy plans a digital hub for public -private partnerships.    The European network of Digital Innovation Hubs (DIHs) is  a network of one -stop shops to support  SMEs’ digitalisation. DIHs provide test beds for technologies, advice on financing options, and  networking and training opportunities. The EU provides funding and encourages cooperation   between DIHs from different regions. The Digital Europe Programme  plans to expand existing DIHs  to include AI and other technologies  (OECD, forthcoming [51]).  Tailored advisory to support businesses’ scale -up   Countries are int roducing a wide range of policy measures and initiatives to spur innovation and AI adoption  by SMEs  (OECD, forthcoming [51]).    Germany’s AI Strategy promotes the transfer of findings from AI research to the economy and the  use o f AI across SMEs (the “Mittelstand”). To remove market barriers and encourage trust and  confidence in emerging technologies, the Federal Government has expanded its information and  advisory services for SMEs and improved the environment for start -ups throu gh regional AI clusters  that foster science -industry collaboration and AI trainers in Mittelstand (SME) 4.0 Excellence  Centres.  ONE AI member Andreas Hartl highlighted the Hubs for Tomorrow initiative, which aims  to build capacity across SMEs and empower SME employees to shape the digital transformation  at the industry level ( Figure  17). The German Labour Ministry has created regional hubs to support  the adoption of trustworthy AI in the workplace: the hubs provide training for employees and tailored  services for SMEs.

Germany’s Hubs for Tomorrow       Source: Presentation by ONE AI member Andreas Hartl (Germany), 9 November 2020, ( Expert  group 6th Meeting).    In the European Union, f ive new public -private research partnerships are planned for launch in  2021 to  increase Europe’s technological sovereignty and build European values and ethics into  products including AI, robotics, machine learning and autonomous vehicles . The European  Com mission’s AI4EU project is an AI -on-demand platform to help EU’s SMEs adopt AI.    The Belgian Start AI program and Tremplin AI program.    Canada has invested EUR 608 million ( CAD  950 million) in five regional Innovation Superclusters ,  one of which focuses on accelerating the application of AI for supply chains ( SCALE.AI ).    The Czech Republic is developing specific support grants and investment programmes for SMEs,  start-ups and spinoffs with innovative services and business models.    Finland’s AI Accelerator , initiated by the Ministry of Economy and Employment with Technology  Industries of Finland, spurs AI use in SMEs.  Finland’s AI Business programme encourages new AI  business ecosystems and investments in Finland.    In Hungary, the AI Innovation Centre was esta blished to serve as a hub for SME’s and start -ups to  support the implementation of AI and data -based solutions. A self -service online platform was  created to display technologies and local case studies to foster collaboration and awareness.     The Maltese Y ouStartIT accelerator.    Portugal has established Digital Innovation Hubs on production technologies, manufacturing, and  agriculture, as well as collaborative laboratories ( CoLabs ) (Portugal, 2019 [60]).    Korea’s AI Open Innovatio n Hub  provides SMEs and start -ups with data, algorithms and high performance computing resources aiming to spur innovation with AI.    In the United Arab Emirates, Dubai Future Accelerators  facilitates collaboration between  government entities, private secto r organisations and start -ups, scale -ups and innovative SMEs to  co-create solutions to global challenges. The United Arab Emirates’ Dubai AI lab  – a partnership  
STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES    57     OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  between various parts of government, IBM and other partners – provides essential tools and go to-market support to implement AI services and applications in different areas.   ONE AI members shared insights on the challenges and opportunities faced by policies promoting an agile  transition from research to commercialisation of AI ( Box 10).

Insights on the challenges and opportunities faced by policies promoting an agile  transition from research to commercialisation of AI19  United Kingdom: Digital Catapult and Innovate UK   ONE AI mem bers discussed the barriers that small businesses face to access AI computing capacity and what the UK government  is doing to help, including a EUR 187 million ( GBP 170 million) investment and ML garage established by the Digital Catapult.  The UK has a net work of catapults helping to promote the adoption of technologies. The digital catapult leads on AI -related efforts  and offers access to compute credits to businesses and links to cloud computing resources, which are vital for businesses tha t  could benefit  from AI but lack the  technical infrastructure. The D igital Catapult works with 30 start -ups per year and uses a  competitive process. To monitor the efficacy of R&D projects, the project relies on a wider framework in place with partners at UK  Research and  Innovation. Innovate UK focuses on commercialisation in some of its programmes like Knowledge Transfer  Networks, which can show “wins” but uses indirect measures of impact and influence such as citations. The UK is focusing on  building the ecosystem this decade and will focus on AI applications next decade. The UK government committed to doubling AI  R&D spending by 2023 -2024.    Two key challenges that faced the UK Office for AI  when implementing its policies were highlighted:      The lack of regular market data: There are gaps in market data on AI compared to established markets, in part because  the wide deployment of AI is recent and discussions about what should be measured are still underway. This is notable  in the communications industry, where the UK’s communications regulator has a statutory duty to provide regular market  intelligence. This is helpful for both public policy and business strategy. While work is ongoing to provide data and  metrics by organisations including the  OECD,  the Stanford  Human -Centred  AI Institute via its AI  Index, and others, data  on the diversity of the AI workforce and data showing AI adoption across sectors (e.g., how fast a sector is moving,  comparative analyses across sectors) are needed.     The need  to prioritise  AI goals: Go vernments need  the right processes and criteria to prioritise the outcomes they want  to secure, especially when considering the level of necessary collaboration across departments and the technical  community.     China: Pilot zones and Open innovation platfo rms  The Chinese government launched pilot AI projects called the “National Pilot Areas for AI Innovative Development” to test the   application of emerging technologies, explore effective policy tools and measure the social impact of technologies. The objec tives  and tasks of the pilot areas are provided by the “Guidance on the Construction of National Pilot Area for the Innovative  Development of New Generation AI” published in August 2019. 11 pilot areas are already launched and the government plans to  create  20 pilot areas in total by the end of 2023.  
STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES    59     OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS    An open innovation platform was created in China where large companies collaborate with SMEs and small research institutions  to build mutual beneficial innovation ecosystems. This would mitigate the disadvanta ge in smaller AI actors that cannot afford  strong computing resources, the collection and accumulation of data and the required multi -disciplinary talent.     Singapore: Triple Helix Partnership between the Research Community, Industry and Government   The go al of Singapore’s Triple Helix Partnership is to enable the rapid commercialisation of fundamental AI research and  deployment of AI solutions through multi -stakeholder collaboration. This initiative aims to deepen investments in AI -related R&D  across the r esearch ecosystem; drive partnerships between the research community and industry (over 15 AI public -private  partnerships and joint labs established to date, e.g., KPMG -A*STAR, Singtel -NTU); accelerate AI adoption in companies; and  establish AI innovation testbeds (e.g., AISG’s 100E Programme supports companies in deploying AI in a co -investment model).   The Working Group on Innovation and Commercialization of the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI)   The working group is exploring practical tools and methods to f oster innovation and accelerate the commercialisation of trustworthy  AI, with a special focus on SMEs. The working group plans several deliverables that will analyse: i) emerging business models   
60  STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES        OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  made possible by AI, ii) how to stimulate innovation and to r educe the time to market, iii) the role of policy to establish trust in  commercialised AI systems throughout the entire life cycle of an Ai system, and iv) intellectual property  issues.

AI skills, jobs and labour market transformation   Building human capacity & preparing for labour market transformation (OECD AI  Principle 2.4)   “Governments should work closely with stakeholders to prepare f or the transformation of the  world of work and of society. They should empower people to effectively use and interact  with AI systems across the breadth of applications, including by equipping them with the  necessary skills.   Governments should take steps, including through social dialogue, to ensure a fair transition  for workers as AI is deployed, such as through training programmes along the working life,  support for those affected by displacement, and access to new opportunities in the labour  market.   Gove rnments should also work closely with stakeholders to promote the responsible use of  AI at work, to enhance the safety of workers and the quality of jobs, to foster  entrepreneurship and productivity, and aim to ensure that the benefits from AI are broadly  and fairly shared.”   Automation is not a new phenomenon, but AI is expected to accelerate the change in the profile of tasks  that can be automated. Many countries are conducting research to understand the impacts of AI in a range  of workplace settings. For example, the United States’ NSF awarded grants under The Future of Work at  the Human -Technology Frontier , a “big idea” programme. The funded projects aim at understanding the  impacts of AI in different workplace settings.   To empower people with the skills  for AI and to prepare them for the labour market transformation,  countries are deploying a myriad of policy initiatives, including: i) establishing formal education  programmes on S cience Technology Engineering  and Mathematics  (STEM) , AI and AI -related fie lds; ii)  devising vocational training and lifelong learning AI and AI -related programmes; iii) providing financial and  non-financial support to retrain and attract AI talent; iv) fostering academic partnerships between public  and private AI research instit utions; and v) monitoring the impact of AI on the labour market for policy  intervention. The first four categories are more developed in the current landscape, while measures  addressing broader labour market trends and challenges remain at a very early sta ge of development.   Establishing formal education programmes on STEM, AI and AI -related fields   Countries have identified AI talent as the bedrock of technological advancement in AI, and education and  skills are a priority for all national AI strategies. On e focus is on increasing the penetration of AI skills at  the national level ( Figure  18). This can be accomplished through formal education and training  programmes on AI, including education in science, technology, e ngineering, and math (STEM); training in  IT and AI tools and methods; and  domain -specific education (Vincent -Lancrin and van der Vlies, 2020 [61]).

It devotes at least USD 200 million  grant per year to promote high -quality computer science and STEM education, including the training for  teachers. Finland plans to create new AI Bachelor’s and master's programmes, as well as promote  incentives and training mechanisms for teachers to use AI in their courses and teaching methods.   Through the National Digital Languages Plan , Chile plans to promote computational thinking and  programming in its educ ational system to build problem -solving and innovation skills. ONE AI member  Carlos Avila (Chile) highlighted that scholarships for doctoral studies abroad were launched through the  pilot initiative Technological Revolution and AI . Chile’s Talent Developme nt Plan  stipulates that the  government will evaluate the effectiveness of this initiative.   In June 2020,  the UK’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport  and the Office for AI  announced  a EUR 15 million (GBP 13 million) budget for the Office for Students to provide degree conversion courses  on data science and AI , including EUR 11.5 million ( GBP 10  million) for up to 1 000 scholarships for people  from diverse backgrounds. Universities and industry partners will provide an additional EUR 12.7 million   (GBP 11 million)  for this programme. At least 2 500 graduate places will be created through the  progr amme, with the first courses starting in autumn 2020. This programme builds on  a pilot  project of  conversion courses in data science. In its AI Roadma p, the UK’s AI Council recommended developing a  specialist curriculum on AI and improving teachers’ k nowledge of AI. At the postgraduate level, the Council  recommended increasing financial support for master’s and PhD programmes. The Council also  recommended tracking and benchmarking the level of diversity and inclusion in AI programmes (UK AI  Council, 2021 [19]).   The Korean government added AI subjects to the curricula of elementary,  middle and high schools. At  universities, AI departments were created  and expanded at 45 universities with a capacity for 4,761  
STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES    63     OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  students. AI grad uate schools are offering masters and doctoral courses to foster talented professionals  (5 graduate schools in  2019 and 8 in 2020).    Devising vocational training and lifelong learning AI and AI -related programmes to  increase AI literacy   Vocational training  and lifelong learning programmes would help the workers and citizens keep up with  technological and societal changes over the long term. This, in turn, ensures that the public can make use  of IT-enabled resources and that the domestic workforce is availab le and qualified for the jobs of the future.  Finland’s Elements of AI programme is a ten -hour Massive Open Online Course that seeks to ensure that  all citizens have a basic understanding of AI. Finland’s AI strategy sets the goal to educate the entire nati on  with basic AI – including people who are employed and the elderly – to build “civic competence”. While  Finland initially targeted the training of 1% of its population, the course attracted more than 100  000  participants, representing more than 2% of the  population. This course is now provided in several official  languages in the EU and will soon be in all of them . Another course on the Ethics of AI  was launched in  Finland in November 2020.   In Korea, the Ministry of Science and ICT established the ICT Inn ovation Squares  in Seoul and 13 regions.  These Squares offers working -level AI education programs in conjunction with regional industries. 600  professionals from 6 industry domains participated in this programme  in 2020, and industry domains were  expanded to 12 areas in 2021 ( Figure  20).

Financial and non -financial to retain and attract AI talent    Many countries are offering fellowships, postgraduate loans, and scholarships to increase domestic AI  research capability and expertise and retain AI talent. Australia has dedicated USD 0.89 mill ion  (AUD  1.4 million) to AI and Machine Learning PhD scholarships.    Canada seeks to retain and attract AI talent with the Canada CIFAR AI Chairs Programme. The  programme provides dedicated funding for five years to world -class AI researchers.   
64  STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES        OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS   Chile  plans to launch a PhD scholarships pilot programme in 2020 to promote targeted studies on  AI.    Singapore seeks to attract AI  talent at the postgraduate level , e.g. the Singapore Digital  Scholarship ( postgraduate) offered by the Infocomm Media Development Authori ty.      The United Kingdom established Turing Fellowships  to attract and retain top AI researchers. ONE  AI member Ed Teather (United Kingdom) presented the plans to increase domestic AI talents by a  fellowship programme to open 2 500 seats for non -STEM to a cquire data science skills.    The United States, the National Science Foundation’s new National AI Research Institutes  programme will also contribute to workforce development, particularly for AI researchers (Parker,  2020 [44]).  There are concerns about the shortage of skilled AI workers and the migration of researchers and  engineers to other countries ( Figure  21). Many national AI strategies also include incentives to attract  foreign skill s and top talent in AI. Belgium plans to attract world -class data and AI talent by introducing  migration quotas to facilitate selective immigration and visa policies for top foreign talent. For example, the  United Kingdom plans to ease visa restrictions fo r PhD researchers from abroad and increase the amount  of Exceptional Talent (Tier 1) visas (up to 2  000 per year) to attract science, technology, AI specialists.

STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES    65     OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  Fostering partnerships between public and private AI research institutions    National AI s trategies support the development of AI education. To that end, they promote collaboration  among government, business, educational and non -profit communities to develop educational  programmes, tools, and technologies. Korea's Smart Training Education Platf orm allows people to take  training programmes that combine theory and field experience. Through its Plattform Lernende Systeme   (Learning Systems Platform), Germany's Federal Ministry of Education and Research brings together  expertise from science, industr y, and society. It is a forum for exchange and co -operation on technological,  economic, and societal challenges regarding the research and application of AI.    Countries are also partnering with the private sector to reskill and upskill the workforce for A I. For example,  in Chile, public -private discussions focus on incorporating AI in the curriculum of Professional Institutes.  Amazon Web Services provides AWS Credits for research and education through programs in Latin  America, including  AWS Educate,  AWS A cademy, and  AWS Training and Certification  supporting data  scientists (AWS, 2019 [62]).  Some large AI actors are supporting students taking AI -related graduate courses around the world. For  example, ONE AI member Jennifer Bernal  (Deepmind) presented Deepmind’s Scholars programme, which  provides financial support to students from underrepresented groups seeking graduate courses (master's  programmes and PhDs). The programme, launched in Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, France,  Greece, Poland, Romania, Turkey, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States, also offers  support from a Deepmind mentor. Similarly, Facebook is collaborating with University College London to  create new AI doctoral research programmes in the UK  and open -source the ir findings.   Monitoring the impact of AI in the labour market   AI is likely to reshape the work environment of many people, by changing the content and design of their  jobs, the way workers interact with each other, with their managers and with machines, and how work effort  and efficiency are monitored. Human -machine collaboration can help workers with tedious or physically  demanding tasks while allowing them to leverage their uniquely human abilities (OECD, 2018 [63]). AI can  provide cheaper, faster, and more scalable solutions in human resource management, helping managers  to manage, and enhancing training. However, the same AI applications create risks. Lack of transparency  and explainability around  algorithmic predictions and decisions can make employees feel insecure, either  psychologically or physically. By enabling extensive monitoring of workers’ performance, AI can increase  work pressure and generate stress about productivity and about how mana gers may interpret data (Lane  and Saint -Martin, 2021 [64]).    Governments are adapting existing policies and developing new strategies to prepare citizens, educators,  and businesses for the jobs of the future and minimi se AI’s negative impacts. This is in line with the AI  principle to enable fair transitions in labour markets. Many national AI policies emphasise retraining for  those displaced by AI, and AI education and training for workers coming into the labour force. ONE AI  member Anna Byhovskaya (Trade Union Advisory Committee to the OECD) emphasised the need for  policy  makers to address the effects of different AI tools and algorithmic management systems in the  workforce and bias and discrimination challenges with al gorithmic human resource management (including  in recruitment), in addition to engaging in social dialogue around these issues and around skills  development ( Figure  22). Social dialogue initiatives include the ‘ Digitization partnership for Denmark's  digital future ’, which discusses labour market transitions and training needs.

Digital change in the World of Work       Source: Presentation by ONE AI member Anna Byhovskaya (TUAC at OEC D), 15 February 2021 (8th meeting).   National institutions are closely monitoring the impact of AI on the labour market. Examples include:    France created a Centre of Excellence for AI to help recruit AI talent and to serve as an advisor  and lab for public policy design.    With the establishment of its AI Observatory, Germany’s Labour Ministry plans to systematically  monitor and analyse the implications of smart and autonomous systems in the world of work.    The Czech Republic will monitor the impact of techno logical changes on the labour market.    Poland also plans to create an AI Observatory for the Labour Market.   At the same time, AI can help governments and others match labour supply and demand. For example,  Korea’s AI service – The Work  – helped 2  666 job seekers find relevant offers that led to a job in the second  quarter of 2019. Korea has since put in place a pilot service using a chatbot named Goyong -yi  (“employment”) to provide 24/7 automated customer support.

It is supported by the German Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (BMAS) and  comple ments the work of the German AI Observatory in the Ministry’s Policy Lab Digital, Work & Society. The Programme  aims at producing in-depth analyses, measurement, opportunities for international dialogue and concrete policy assessments  on how AI impacts lab our markets and societies. Through collaboration with international policy, research, and business  communities, as well as labour union representatives and civil society, the OECD will identify necessary employment, skills,  and social policy reforms.   The first international conference of AI -WIPS was held virtually in February 2021 ( https://www.oecd.ai/work -innovation productivity -skills/events ).

AI policy intelligence to  monitor implementation   A few countries have launched policy intelligence activities and is sued annual reports to evaluate the  implementation of their national AI strategies.   Canada, Germany, Singapore, United Kingdom, United  States, and the European Commission  had published reports that monitored and evaluated the  implementation of their AI st rategies. Countries highlight milestones and accomplishments in these reports.  These types of monitoring and evaluation publications can be expected to expand across countries as  national AI strategies move into later stages of implementation.     Several na tional or regional institutions have established AI observatories to oversee the implementation  of national AI strategies and policies. For example, the German  Labour Ministry launched the  KIObservatorium  in March 2020 to help implement parts of Germany’s  AI strategy and encourage the  responsible, people -centred,  and participatory use of AI in the world of work and society. Other  observatories include:  the Czech Republic’s AI Observatory and Forum  (AIO&F); Quebec’s International  Observatory on the Social I mpacts of Artificial and Digital Intelligence  in Canada; France’s  Observatory on  the Economic and Social Impact of AI; the  Italian Observatory on AI; and Chile is considering an  Observatory on AI and established  a Labour Observatory to analyse the internal  ecosystem, gather new  evidence, and incorporate this evidence base into policy.   Some countries report more detailed assessments, including information such as budgets, funding, and  specific targets. Some countries are also developing different indicators to measure progress across  different AI policy domains:    Canada’s CIFAR also produced an annual report summarising the  organisation’s  key activities  including its Evaluation Strategy Framework. A performance measurement matrix is used by  CIFAR to monitor qu alitative data by categorising each activity into desired outputs, short intermediate -long term outcomes, and the ultimate desired impact.21  In October 2020, CIFAR  released the Pan -Canadian AI Strategy Impact Assessment Report (CIFAR, 2020 [65]). This report  highlights the strategy’s impact on the following domains and Canadian regions:    Commercialisation and adoption of AI : 50% growth in foreign direct investment in ICTs from 2017  to 2019.    Research & development : 109 leading resear chers recruited and retained in Canada through the  Canada CIFAR AI Chairs program. In 2019, Canadians Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton (along  with their colleague Yann LeCun), won the ACM A.M. Turing Award, widely considered the “Nobel  Prize of Computing” .    Talent and job creation : The strategy helped create a Canadian ecosystem that attracts and retains  highly skilled talent.    Education : enrolment in math, computer and information science postsecondary programmes grew  by 26% since 2015/16, compared to 3% growth for all topics.  
STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES    69     OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS   Social : Canadian research institutes CIFAR, Amii, Mila and the Vector Institute prioritise AI for  Good across societal causes including health, education, and the environment through a portfolio  of programs.    Responsible AI : Canada an d France founded the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI) focusing on  responsible AI.    Regional Impact Evaluation : The establishment of three AI institutes, Amii, Mila, and the Vector  Institute, created a collaborative network across Canada, enabling regions to  deepen their  respective specialised strengths while building cross -regional synergies.    Colombia is developing policy intelligence tools to monitor the implementation of i) national AI  policies, ii) emerging good practices to implement the OECD AI recomme ndations to governments,  and iii) AI projects in the public sector:    SisCONPES is a tool that monitors the implementation of every action line in the AI national  strategy . It reports advances and challenges in implementation to entities leading the  impleme ntation of the strategy, notably the Presidency of the Republic.    A follow -up plan to monitor the implementation of the OECD AI Principles and identify good  practices matches specific actions implemented by the Colombian government to the OECD  recommendatio ns to governments.    The GovCo Dashboard monitors the implementation of AI projects in the public sector. The  dashboard includes a description of each project and highlights the mechanisms through which AI  is used and the progress of each project.   These pol icy intelligence tools are also used by the Presidency and the AI Office to evaluate  resource allocation and evaluate policy implementation.    In 2019, Germany published an interim report detailing the work accomplished in the first year of  its AI strategy. Beginning with a statistical summary, the report outlines German accomplishments  regarding AI publications, patent applications, percentage increases in new AI start -ups, as well as  expanded academic, undergraduate, and graduate positions. The report highl ights the need for  consolidating the governance framework. The report mentioned the call for a regulatory framework  over algorithmic systems raised by the Data Ethics Committee. The governance framework also  establishes guidelines for funding aimed at deve loping user -friendly AI applications to improve user  protection and quality of life. The government has also drafted a roadmap regarding AI standards  and has stressed the need for stronger  standardisation  in the AI landscape.     In December 2020, Germany pu blished an updated report on the German AI strategy. With this  update, the federal government is responding to current developments and high -priority topics such  as the COVID -19 pandemic, environmental and climate protection; and complementing the  strategy  with further measures (BMBF, 2020 [38]).   The UK’s Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation  (CDEI) launched an “AI Barometer” that identifies  public distrust of AI as a key barrier that needs  addressing (CDEI, 2020 [66]).22 The AI Council  launched an AI Roadmap in late 2020 providing recommendations to the government (UK AI  Council, 2021 [19]). In 2019, the UK Office for AI released its first -year report on the 2018 AI Sector  Deal that highlights:23:    Business environment  – the establishment of the Office for AI, the AI Council, and the Centre for  Data Ethics and Innovation ;   People  – funding more doctoral training, launching AI Turing Fellowships, opening AI Masters  programs, and creating conversion courses  to bring non -STEM students into AI ;    Infrastructure  – piloting data trusts ;   Place  –  funding centers  of excellence for AI applications in healthcare;  and    Ideas  – collaborating with the private sector to expand R&D .

For example, the report discusses the White House Office of Management and  Budget’s creation of the Federal Data Strategy to help federal agencies harness data and AI for  their work. The publication takes stock of the US government’s efforts to expand access to AI  resources and promote the right environment for inn ovation and research through regulatory  guidelines and technical standards. Impacts to the American workforce is also a priority area for  monitoring efforts in the American AI strategy.24     The EU’s 2018 Coordinated Action Plan on the development of AI anno unced the creation of AI  Watch, the “European Commission Knowledge Service to Monitor the Development, Uptake and  Impact of Artificial Intelligence Policy for Europe” ( Box 12).25 In April 2021, as part of its AI  legislative package) the European Commission updated its Coordinated Plan with EU Member  States.

European Commission – Joint Research Centre  (AI Watch)   AI Watch is  an initiative  developed by the  European Commission - Joint Resear ch Centre and DG CONNECT of the European  Commission. It monitors AI -related development and provides analyses to support the implementation of the European AI  initiatives. JRC is also developing a methodology to identify risks and opportunities, drivers, a nd barriers of the use AI in public  service provision. In February 2020, JRC launched a report on national AI strategies of EU member countries, the objective  of which is “to present and gather information on all EU Member States' national AI strategies in  a structured and  comprehensive way” (see table below). It aims to help Member States compare their strategy and identify areas for  strengthening synergies and collaboration. The EU’s effort to monitor implementation develops a harmonised policy framework  by assessing each Member State’s strategy through specific policy areas: human capital, research, networking, infrastructure,   and regulation. The purpose of this framework is to enable comparisons by policy makers in each country.26   Overview of national AI  strategies in the EU Member States and Norway       Note: Last update of the table on 15 March 2021. The information in the table is based on input from national contact points or public  sources. It presents release dates of national AI strategies in their native language.

International and multi stakeholder co-operation on  AI   International co -operation f or trustworthy AI ( OECD AI Principle 2.5)   “Governments, including developing countries and with stakeholders, should actively  cooperate to advance these principles and to progress on responsible stewardship of  trustworthy AI.   Governments should work togeth er in the OECD and other global and regional fora to foster  the sharing of AI knowledge, as appropriate. They should encourage international, cross sectoral, and open multi -stakeholder initiatives to garner long -term expertise on AI.   Governments should pro mote the development of multi -stakeholder, consensus -driven  global technical standards for interoperable and trustworthy AI.   Governments should also encourage the development, and their own use, of internationally  comparable metrics to measure AI research,  development and deployment, and gather the  evidence base to assess progress in the implementation of these principles.”   International AI research collaboration   Countries are promoting cross -border research collaboration on AI ( Figure  23). For example, the French  National Research Agency, the German Research Foundation and the Japanese Science and Technology  Agency have agreed on trilateral collaboration in AI research  over three  years . Some project s started in 2020 .  The United Kingdom and the United States signed a “Declaration on Cooperation in AI R&D” that envisages  i) using bilateral science and technology cooperation and multilateral cooperation frameworks; ii)  recommending priorities for future cooperation, part icularly in R&D areas; iii) coordinating the planning and  programming of relevant activities in areas that have been identified; and (iv) promoting R&D in AI, focusing  on challenging technical issues  in 2020 .29 Canada and Germany are working together to adv ance AI  industrialisation by organising joint R&D projects on the application of AI technologies in manufacturing,  as applied to manufacturing, supply chain and other fields (Canada, 2020 [67]).   Many EU countries are also parti cipating in European AI research projects and networks such as  BVDA/EURobotics , the Confederation of Laboratories for AI Research in Europe ( CLAI RE) and the 
74  STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES        OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems ( ELLIS ). AI is also a priority in Horizon Europe,  the EU’s next framework programme for research and innovation.   Figure  23.

Many inter -governmental organisations with complementary mandates and  membership are engaged in AI initiatives and projects. Several of these activities are listed in what follows.  The OECD and other intergovernmental organisations are  also engaged in the development of a neutral  platform entitled “ GlobalPolicy.ai ” to share information on the AI initiatives and projects undertaken by  these organisations.   Regional co -operation is also taking place.  In 2018, several Nordic and Baltic cou ntries agreed to  collaborate on AI policies, including skills development, access to data and standard -setting exercises.30  The Arab AI Working Group, formed in 2019 by the Arab League members, aims to i)  develop a joint  framework for capacity building in t he Arab region;  ii) raise awareness of the opportunities and challenges  of AI; iii) train youth to compete in AI jobs; and iv)  establish a common Arab Strategy, including a regulatory  framework for AI. The African Union set up a working group on AI to crea te a joint capacity -building  framework across the continent under Egypt’s presidency in 2020. This will help address skills gaps and  prepare African youth for future jobs; identify and initiate AI projects across Africa to serve the Sustainable  Development  Goals (SDGs ), and establish a common AI strategy for Africa.   Some countries are leveraging trade agreements to enhance co -operation on AI. For example, in 2020,  Chile, New Zealand and Singapore signed the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA)  which  aims to promote the safe and responsible use of AI technologies.31 Australia and Singapore, building on  
STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES    75     OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  their pre -existing trade agreement, also signed the Singapore -Australia Digital Economy Agreement  (SADEA) in the same year, where Parties agreed to adv ance their co -operation on AI .32   CAF - Development Bank of Latin America   The CAF has conducted work on AI and a data policy development project, to provide technical cooperation  to Latin -American countries working on the design and implementation of AI pol icies. An example of this  cooperation work with the Colombian Government to develop the first draft of Colombia’s ethical AI  framework, a model for implementing AI regulatory sandboxes and a data governance model. CAF has  been leading the design and implem entation of Colombia's AI Office. CAF has recently also begun  collaborating with the Government of Peru on Peru’s AI Strategy.   Council of Europe   The Council of Europe and its bodies have been examining the impact of AI and have published several  recommenda tions. In September 2019, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe set up the Ad  Hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence (CAHAI). This committee was examining the feasibility of  developing a legal framework for the development, design, and appl ication of AI, based on the Council’s  standards on human rights, democracy, and rule of law. In April 2020, the same Committee of Ministers  issued a set of guidelines calling on governments to take a precautionary approach to the development  and use of alg orithmic systems. It further called for the adoption of legislation, policies and practices that  fully respect human rights. In June 2020, the CAHAI established three working groups.   CAHAI’s Policy Development Group developed a feasibility study for a leg al framework on AI applications  - which was adopted by the CAHAI in December 2020 - and proposals for engaging with and consulting  relevant external stakeholders. The Consultations and Outreach Group is taking stock of the results of the  online consultatio n and preparing a stakeholder analysis and mapping. The Legal Frameworks Group  started in January 2021 to work on proposals for provisions for a legal framework, with specific regulatory  proposals for the development, design, and application of AI in areas  identified as risky by member states  and other stakeholders.   European Commission   The multi -stakeholder High -Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG) was convened by the  European Commission to support the implementation of the European Stra tegy on AI and completed its  four outputs in July 202033: Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in April 2019, Policy and  Investment Recommendations for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in June 2019, an updated Assessment  List for Tru stworthy Artificial Intelligence (ALTAI) in July 2020, and Sectoral Considerations on the Policy  and Investment Recommendations in July 2020.34 The European AI Alliance is a multi -stakeholder forum  for engaging in a broad and open discussion of all aspects of AI development and policy, and its impact  on the economy and society.35 In April 2021, the EC published the “AI legislative package” that comprises:  i) a Proposal for a Regulation on a European approach for Artificial Intelligence (Box 6); ii) an updated   Coordinated Plan with Member States, and iii) a Proposal for a Regulation on Machinery Products.   G20  Under the Japanese Presidency  in 2019 , the G20 agreed to commit  to a human -centred approach to AI  and adopted the G20 AI Principles , which  were drawn from  the OECD AI Principles. Under the Saudi   presidency  in 2020 , the G20 agreed to advance the G20 AI Principles in each country. The OECD  contributed to the 2020 Declaration of G20 Digital Economy Ministers  by providing a report on examples  of policies to adv ance the AI Principles  (OECD, 2020[68]) ; and (G20, 2020[69]) . The G20 is continuing

GPAI    The Global Partnership on AI (GPAI) is an international and multi -stakeholder initiative , conceived by  Canada and France during their respective 2018 and 2019 G7 presidencies , to undertake cutting -edge  research and pilot projects on AI priorities to adva nce the responsible development and use of AI. The  Partnership was launch ed in June 2020  with 15 founding members: Australia, Canada, France , Germany,  India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Korea, Singapore, Slovenia, the United Kingdom , the United  States, and the European Union. In December 2020, Brazil, the Netherlands, Poland,  and Spain joined  GPAI .   GPAI is led by  a ministerial -level Council and a Steering Committee, and is supported by a dedicated  Secretariat hosted by the OECD, as well as two Centr es of Expertise: one in Montreal (the International  Centre of Expertise in Montreal for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (ICEMAI)) and one in Paris  (at the French National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology (INRIA)).   GPAI brings together leading AI experts from industry, government, civil society , and academia to  collaborate across four current working groups on the themes of: i) responsible AI (including a subgroup  on AI and pandemic response), ii) data governance, iii) the  future of work, and iv) innovation and  commerciali sation. The Montreal Centre of Expertise supports the first two working groups, while the Paris  Centre of Expertise supports the latter two working groups.   As the 2020 -2021 GPAI Chair, Canada hosted the i naugural GPAI Summit in December 2020 , which  included the first meetings of GPAI’s governance bodies ( the Council and Steering Committee) . The  summit also featured the GPAI Multistakeholder Experts Group Plenary , which brought together over 200  leading AI experts  to discuss the activities of GPAI’s working groups to date . France will be hosting the  2021 GPAI Summit as the 2021 -2022 GPAI Chair. More information on GPAI is available at https://gpai.ai/.   IDB (Inter -American Development Bank)   The Inter -American  Development Bank (IDB) is engaged in the  ‘fAIr LAC’ initiative to promote the  responsible and ethical use of AI and improve the public services e.g., education, health, and social  protection, in Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries. Working  with t he public and private sectors,  civil society,  and academia, IDB implements experiments and pilot projects of AI systems in LAC countries.  The initiative includes the creation of a regional observatory to map and track AI projects and AI use  cases.36 As part  of the work that fAIr LAC is doing with the HUBs, they recently begun collaborating with  the Government of Costa Rica in designing its roadmap for national AI strategy and its ethical framework  and creating a space for knowledge exchange between different  countries seeking to advance in its own  strategies.   ITU (International Telecommunication Union)   Beginning in 2017, the ITU operated “AI for Good”, an annual Summit along with an action -oriented, global  and inclusive platform on AI (in partnership with the  XPRIZE Foundation, other UN agencies, the Swiss  Government and ACM). The goal of this platform is to identify practical applications of AI and scale those  solutions for global impact, to accelerate progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Th e  2019 Summit gave rise to ‘AI Commons’, a framework for collaboration for AI development and application.  ITU published reports summarising the work undertaken by other UN agencies to address AI related  challenges.  In May 2021, ITU published a report to h elp policy makers overcome the barriers and embrace  the huge development opportunities offered by AI and big data technologies (ITU, 2021 [70]).  
STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OECD AI PRINCIPLES: INSIGHTS FROM NATIONAL AI POLICIES    77     OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS  OECD   OECD member countries adopted a set of AI principles in May 2019, the first s et of intergovernmental  principles and recommendations to governments for trustworthy AI. Early 2020, the OECD launched  OECD.AI, a platform to share and shape AI policies that provides data and multidisciplinary analysis on  artificial intelligence. Also in  early 2020, the OECD’s Committee on Digital Economy Policy tasked the  OECD .AI Network of Experts (ONE AI) with proposing practical guidance for implementing the OECD AI  principles for trustworthy AI through the activities of three working groups. The O ECD .AI expert  group on  the classification of AI systems is developing a user -friendly framework to classify and help policy makers  navigate AI systems and understand the different policy considerations associated with different types of  AI systems. The O ECD. AI expert group on implementing trustworthy AI is identifying practical guidance  and shared procedural approaches to help AI actors and decision -makers implement effective, efficient  and fair policies for trustworthy AI. The OE CD.AI expert group on national  AI policies developed  this report  to identify practical guidance and good practices for implementing the five recommendations to policy  makers contained  in the OECD AI Principles.   UNESCO   UNESCO has organised events to exchange knowledge about AI, focusing  on the dimensions of ethics,  policy and capacity building. In March 2020, UNESCO appointed 24 leading experts to an Ad Hoc Expert  Group (AHEG) on the ethics of AI. UNESCO’s November 2019 General Conference tasked the AHEG with  elaborating a recommendation  on the ethics of artificial intelligence, which will be considered for adoption  in November 2021.   United Nations (UN)  The United Nations’ Secretary -General presented his “Roadmap for Digital Cooperation ” in June 2020 to  address issues related to AI and o ther digital technologies as well as encourage global cooperation. The  Roadmap builds on the recommendations made by the High -level Panel on Digital Cooperation in June  2019. Among the roundtable groups of experts created to discuss the implementation of t he Roadmap,  ‘Roundtable 3C’ is working to identify and share knowledge and best practices in key areas of AI  development, governance, and use. In April 2021, the UN published the “Resource Guide on AI Strategies ”  to lay out existing resources on AI ethics,  policies and strategies on national, regional and international  level.   World Bank   The “Harnessing AI for Development” initiative at the World Bank aims to understand the role of  governments in fostering AI development and adoption in developing countries.  The work highlights how  governments are designing policy and regulatory frameworks around AI to support their unique  development needs and make progress towards tackling each of the UN Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs).
