GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13   3    STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use  Key Findings    Digitisation is viewed as a new source of growth, efficiency  and relevance in today’s  increasingly digital world.  Governments and public sector organisations are embracing new  and emerging technologies for developing innovative approaches to policy making, service  delivery and public value creation. Building on the insights and data collected from 20  OECD member and partner countries, t his working  paper tries to capture the current state  of the art on public sector adoption of emerging  technologies, with a specific focus on AI  and blockchain . It will discuss some of the associated challenges and opportunities and  provide a preliminary set of policy guidance. Key findings include:   Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain hold  considerable potential for making the public sector smarter, i.e. more agile, efficient,  user-friendly and , as a result , more trustworthy. For instance , AI can be used to deliver   more effective ly personalised  services and to foster citizen engagement  with public  institutions, through the design  of human -centric interface s; enhanc e operational efficiency   and the quality of administrative procedures through increased automation of physical and  digital tasks; and,  to enable greater predictive capabilities  for better deci sion making and  policy outcomes,   through the use of algorithms designed to uncover tren ds and patterns in  large volumes of data . Blockchain, if properly applied in a public sector environment,  yields significant benefits in terms of increased transparency , accountability  and security   through stronger data integrity and  immutability across ag encies; as well as efficiency gains   resulting  from the reduction of processing time and costs thanks to contract automation  (socalled ‘smart contracts’) .  Governments can play multiple roles to strengthen national research capacity and  translate technologi cal progress into public sector applications  that deliver public  value :    Government as a convener , through the adoption of an overarching  strategy  that  showcases high-level political commitment . Many countries have announced  national strategies and policy initiatives to advance the digital government agenda  and ensure a leadership position in emerging technologies like AI.    Government as financier , typically through the provision of direct or indirect funds  to support the research, development and adoption o f emerging technologies.    Government as direct user and co -developer , together with public sector  organisations , can act through innovative procurement practices, or as a proactive  co-developer through  public -private partnerships , and other forms of collaboration ,  to build tailored solutions.    Government as a regulator , as the diversity of challenges raised by the digital  transformation calls for a reassessment of existing policy frameworks, holistic  approaches to ensure policy cohe rence and international regulatory co -operation .  Governments worldwide are experimenting with emerging technologies to better meet  the needs of public -service users and steward coherent use of  resources  to maximise  public value . These projects increasingly  centre around the applications of AI and more  recently of blockchain. They fall under four broad  areas: ( i) enhancing the quality of 
4  GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13     STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use welfare services; ( ii) increasing operational efficiency and security; ( iii) preserving the  environment, natural capital a nd climate resilience; and ( iv) making data -driven policy  decisions for better governance.   Specifically, governments exploring the role of AI tend to focus on projects where human machine interaction s can provide better user experience s and/or free up res ources for higher  value -adding tasks . Experiments  are currently concentrated in  the health, transportation and  security sectors . Common use cases for blockchain in the public sector have so far  addressed issues related to digital identity and certificates,  personal records  authentication ,  welfare benefits or entitlements, asset registries, and inter - or intragovernmental  transactions. They generally leverage three core features  of blockchain in terms of  recordkeeping and authentication, value transfer, and smart contracts.   Governments fac e multiple challenges in how to incorporate these emerging  technologies for public purposes. A review of existing practices has identified thre e types  of challenge, including: technical and practical challenges , such as the availability of  quality data and lack of common standards; resource and capacity constraints , typically  inadequate investment and funding, and low digital literacy and skills shortage in the public  sector; and institutional, legal and cultural barriers , notably regulatory gaps and  insufficient political and institutional buy -in. Among these, the absence of common  standa rds and suitable legal frameworks are the most quoted obsta cles, in part due to  growing concerns around fairness, transparency, data privacy and accountability/legal  liability arising from the introduction of AI and blockchain.   A paradigm shift will be essential to adopt systematic and whole -of-organisation  appro aches to the digital transformation of the public sector. Meaningful, sustainable  and resilient use of emerging technologies within governments and public sector  organisations  require s strategic vision and leadership commitment, suitable organisational  and governance frameworks , new working methods  and capabilities to support agile and  efficient design, implementation  and delivery of public policies and services. Notably,  political support and engagement with the private sector have been identified as two m ajor  enablers for public sector adoption of emerging technologies.   Going forward, governments could consider focusing actions on the following key  areas , indicated in the OECD Recommendation on Artificial Intelligence,  to integrate  emerging technologies in their overall digital transformation agenda:    Establishing a suitable governance framework to facilitate the use of technology  in public sector . Such  framework could consist of: whole -of-government  approaches that secure coherence among different arms of the administration; a  core group dedicated to coordinating planning and implementation; and structured  forms of engagement with key stakeholders in the relevant ecosystems;    Promoting synergies across public sector organisations  that can support a  purpose -oriented and problem -driven adoption of AI and blockchain, as well other  ETs, to improve policies, processes and services to the benefits of  citizens and  businesses. Acquiring adequate competencies and capacities within the public  sector , starting with building  a dedicated pool of civil servants  and experts capable  of identifying appropriate technologies for rethinking a given task, purpose or  need;    Experimenting and piloting , for instance by identify ing a portfolio of priority  projects to test agile approaches  and spot scale -up opportunities  where the adoption  of emerging technologies  would be most  meaningful, feasible and cost-efficient ; 
GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13   5    STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use   Reassessing  existing legal and regulatory frameworks  to address the social,  ethical and legal challenges raised by emerging technologies;    Stepping up collaboration with the private sector  to lever industry progress in  emerging technologies and support open in novation;    Joint ly participating in international and/or regional projects , developing  synergies among government s for research, testing, implementation and  monitoring of ET in this public policy stream.

Note from the Secretariat   This Working P aper was prepared by the Reform of the Public Sector Division of the  OECD Directorate  for Public Governance and the Working Party of Senior Digital  Government Officials (E -Leaders).    This Working Paper is intended to highlight  the main opportunities and ch allenges for the   use of emerging technologies (ET) , and in particular emerging digital technologies, in the  public sector. The analysis included shall contribute to a better understand ing of the  implications, requirements and impacts of using ET to foster the digital transformation of  the public sector , in line with the main findings of the analytical work conducted by the  Thematic Group ( TG) on the Use of Emerging Technologies (AI and blockchain) . Based  on the first results of the analysis  of evidence coll ected in 20 countries , the paper  offers a  few insights on  the state of the art on the strategies and practical examples on how  governments are attempting to integrat e ET in the public sector.     This paper is a key contribution to the broader analysis of the OECD on the implications  of the digital transformation  affecting economies, societies and governments, framed under  the horizontal project Going Digital  (OECD,  2019 [1]). The paper complements existing  work streams on blockchain (Berryhill, Bourgery and Hanson, 2018 [2]), and AI  (OECD,  2019 [3]).  This document was draft ed by the Agency for Digital Italy staff and experts (Enzo Maria  Le Fevre, with the support of Elisa Petrucci, Pietro Marchionni, Claudio Biancalana and  Nanni Hiltunen, under the supervision of Daniela Maria Intravaia) together with the OECD  Secretariat (B arbara -Chiara Ubaldi, Deputy Head of Division and head of the Digital  Government and Open Data Team in the Reform of the Public Sector Division, Public  Governance Directorate). Colleagues from within the OECD including Jamie Berryhill,  from the Observatory on Public Sector Innovation, Alistair Nolan, Laura Galindo -Romero,  Karine Perset, Gallia Daor and Nobuhisa Nishigata, reviewed and provided comments.  Irène Hors, Deputy Director of the Public Governance Directorate, pr ovided strategic  advises and João Ricardo Vasconcelos, digital government policy analyst, served as the  lead coordinator of the document, under the supervis ion of Barbara -Chiara Ubaldi.  The  document benefitted from the editorial support and substantive con tribution provided by  Chan Yang, Strategy and Business Development Consultant on Technologies for Impact.   The document builds on the output produced by the E -Leaders Thematic Group on  Emerging Technologies (Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain) presented  in the meeting  of the Working Party of Senior Digital Government Officials (E -Leaders), hosted by the  Korean government in Seoul on 30-31October  2018 . It benefited from the precious  experience and active collaboration of all the countries members of the mentioned E Leaders Thematic Group: Italy (coordinator of the Thematic Group), Argentina, Australia,  Canada, Chile, Colombia, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Korea, Latvia, Netherlands, New  Zealand, Panama, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, Urugu ay, and the  European Commission (DG Connect and DG Digit).

GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13   7    STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use  1.1. Scope  and structure of the paper   Discussions around emerging technologies and their implications for the public sector are  high on the global agenda. Governments have started developing focu sed strategies and  devoting specific budget s to advance the use of specific applications of these technologies ,  both in the public and private sectors.     One of the main challenges that governments face is the integration o f emerging  technologies into efforts of public sector modernisation. The objective is to overcome  sectoral silos and use emerging technologies as part of overall public sector reform and  development strateg ies. Such a challenge is not novel for policy makers. The OECD  Recommendation of t he Council on Digital Government Strategies (OECD, 2014 [4])  suggests a set of policy actions aimed to support an uptake of digital opportunities that  advance the global political agenda of a country based on a whole -of-government approach ,  rather than  one driven by s ector -based approaches which still prevail  in many parts of the  world .  The OECD Recommendation on AI, adopted in 2019, further recommends  national  policies and international co -operation for fostering trustworthy AI, including in the public  sector.   For this reason,  the TG considered it essential  to adopt an evidence -based  approach in order  to understand how each participant  country is intro ducing  ET solutions into public  administration and government services . It shares in particular insights into national  strategies and approaches on ET development and implementation , providing an initial  picture of the main opportunities and challenges for  the use of ET in the public sector.  The  paper analyses the main actors involved, as well as the major enablers and constraints to  the use of these technologies in the public sector  with a government -wide perspective .  With this purpose, this paper maps the  current use of ET in the public sector across  18  OECD member countries and 2 non -member countries1. The mapping is not aimed at  ranking countries’ performances, but at identifying  strategic approaches, key actors and  existing networks in the sector, sharing good  practices or on -going experiments among  OECD countries and identifying the main implications for countries at different stages of  use of disruptive technologies in the public sector .   Input from the Europea n Commission, which took part in the work of the TG , complements  the analysis based on country evidence.    The paper includes the following sections :    Section  2 sets the context to understand the main advances in emerging  technologies, with focus on artifi cial intelligence (AI) and blockchain , and  discuss es their scope, development and relevant features for public sector uses .   Section  3 illustrate s recent trends in the adoption of AI and blockchain technologies  in the public sector , based on empirical findi ngs from the 20 TG countries .  Specifically, it reviews the presence of national strategies and main actors tasked  with advancing the digital government agenda; present s the level and forms of  government support for encouraging public sector uptake of ET; a nd finally, maps  the main areas of AI and blockchain adoption by public sector organisations.                                                           1 See Annex A  
8  GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13     STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use  Section  4 discusses the major obstacles to the adoption and application of emerging  digital technologies in the public sector. It then offers a set of preliminar y lessons  learnt on key enablers and success factors, and ends with a few questions for further  research to help governments better navigate their digital transformation agenda.   1.2. Methodology   The document presents the results of the analysis of the state of the art on ET uptake by  participants  of the TG, with the  aim to provide a picture of the main related opportunities  and challenges .  The analysis  covers the period from Ja nuary 2018 t o July 2019 . It includ es the gathering of  evidence collected through a questionnaire2 conducted among TG participants , to identify  and share existing practices and on-going experiments, and to highlight the main challenges  faced by countries at different stages of adoption of ET.   In addition, the paper benefit s from a mapping of ET3 in the public sector. It analyses how  these technologies have been integrated  and contributing to improving the quality of public  policies and services.    For the sake of clarity, we specify that countries are always mentioned in alphabetical order.                                                             2 See Annex B   3 See Annex C. 
GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13   9    STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use  2.  Brief introduction to emerging digital technologies    Digitalisation  trends  over the past three decades  have offered increasing opportunities for  the public sector to develop innovative approaches to policy making, service delivery and  public value creation.  From mainframe computing in the late 1950s, to the introduction of  personal computers in the late 1970s a nd the advent of the internet and open networks in  the 1990s, governments and public sector organisations have a long history of using  technolog ies to improve internal and external collaboration, better plan resources and  procurement operations, inform dec ision -making and reform service delivery, in line with  the changing needs of citizens and businesses  (OECD, 2003; 2005; 2009; 2011) .   As an emerging technology  (ET)  can quickly become mainstream or disappear altogether  depending on its pace of development , adoption  and whether it is superseded by a better  technology , this working paper has adopted the following definition: “those technologies  of recent adoption, or currently under development,  offer disruption to the current  operating models of government and allow for innovative solutions for public policy and  service delivery , and to the socio -economic context overall .4” A common list of ETs5 has  been prepared by the T hematic Group (T G) to guide the sharing of information about the  solutions that are bein g integrated into the process of policymaking and public service  delivery.  This section will focus on two emerging digital technologies – artificial  intelligence  and blockchain , and discuss briefly their  scope, development and  relevant  features for public sector uses.   2.1. Artificial intelligence  (AI)  What is AI   There is no universally accepted definition of  AI, p artly because our understanding of what  constitutes “intelligence” has evolved over time and entails a concept of a cognitive  capability which is highly fluid .   The OECD has adopted the following definition of  AI, “a machine -based system that can,  for a given set of human -defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or  decisions inf luencing real or virtual environments ” (OECD, 2019 [3]) (OECD, 2019 [5]). It  does so by utilising machine and/or human -based inputs to:  i) perceive real and/or virtual  envir onments; ii) abstract such perceptions into models through analysis in an automated  manner e.g. with machine learning, or manually; and iii) use model inference to formulate  options for information or action ” (OECD, 2019 [3]). AI systems are designed to operate  with varying levels of autonomy . Box 2.1 describes the main phases of the AI system  lifecycle.                                                          4 Daniele Rotolo  (University of Sussex) , Diana Hicks  (Georgia Institute of Technology ) and  Ben R.  Martin  (University of Sussex ) define  ET as one bearing the following attributes: (i) radical novelty,  (ii) relatively fast growth, (iii) coherence, (iv) prominent impact, and (v) uncertainty and ambiguity.   (Rotolo, Hicks and Martin, 2015 )  5 See Annex C.  
10  GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13     STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use Box 2.1. The AI system lifecycle   An AI system incorporates many of the phases involved in traditional software  development lifecycles and system development lifecycles more generally but contains  specific features. The AI system lifecycle typically involves the following phases:  i) ‘design, data and m odels’, which is a context -dependent sequence encompassing  planning and design, data collection and processing, as well as model building and  interpretation; ii) ‘verification and validation’; iii) ‘deployment’; and iv) ‘operation and  monitoring’. These ph ases often take place in an iterative manner and are not necessarily  sequential. The decision to retire an AI system from operation may occur at any point  during the operation and monitoring phase.   The AI system lifecycle phases can be described as follow s:  i. Design, data and modelling includes several activities, whose order may vary:   o Planning and design of the AI system involves articulating the system’s  concept and objectives, underlying assumptions, context and  requirements, and potentially building a p rototype.   o Data collection and processing  includes gathering and cleaning data,  performing checks for completeness and quality, and documenting the  metadata and characteristics of the dataset. Dataset metadata  include  information on how a dataset was created, its composition, its intended  uses, and how it has been maintained over time.   o Model building and interpretation  involves the creation or selection  models or algorithms, their calibration and/or training and interpretation.   ii. Verification and valida tion involve executing and tuning models, with tests to  assess performance across various dimensions and considerations.   iii. Deployment into live production involves piloting, checking compatibility with  legacy systems, ensuring regulatory compliance, managin g organisational change,  and evaluating user experience.   iv. Operation and monitoring of an AI system involves operating the AI system and  continuously assessing its recommendations and impacts (both intended and  unintended) in light of objectives and ethical  considerations. In this phase,  problems are identified and adjustments made by reverting to other phases or, if  necessary, deciding to retire an AI system from production.

GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13   11    STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use  AI developments : past and present   AI is not new . AI has gone through three springs  of development. The first spring  running  from 1950s to mid -1970s saw research efforts concentrating on making intelligent  machines and robots , following logic -based approache s. Early work on logical reasoning,  character recognition and natural language processing was developed and AI gained ground  as an area of interest.   In 1958, Frank Rosenblatt, a psychologist in Cornell, created a pattern recognition model  that forms the basis of today’s complex neural networks (Rosenblatt, 1958). A year later,  Arthur Samuel, an American pioneer in computer gaming and AI, coined the term  “Machine Learning  (ML) ” devising one of the world’s first successful self -learning  checkers -playing programme ( Samuel, 1959).    The second AI spring  (1980 -1987)  was characterised by knowledge -based systems  (e.g.  expert systems) , which, by definition, were c omputer programmes that answer or solve  problems about a specific domain using logical rules derived from the knowledge of  experts. Despite being very good at reasoning over narrowly defined problems, the se  systems failed to deliver learning and abstractin g capabilities that many view as being  major parts of intelligence. They were also difficult to scale due to cumbersome manual  rules -writing process es.   Continuing technological progress over the past three decades have led to the third and  current spring  of AI development driven by statistical learning . Starting from the 1990s ,  technological progress had made the task of building systems driven by real -world data  more feasible. The capacity  of Internet as well as the entire landscape of digital devices  that generate data streams  for gathering large amounts of data  (known as “big data”) , and  the increased availability of computing power and storage to process that data enabled  statistical techniques  (e.g. ML and Deep Learning)  which , by design, derive solutions from  data. Current AI systems are characterised by good performance in learning (e.g.  categorisation tasks, facial and voice recognition), but do not yet have strong reasoning  abilities to understand the context in which these  tasks are taking place , or to abstract  knowledge from one domain and apply it to another .   In recent years, ML  has emerged as the dominant approach of AI technology  (Figure 2.1).  It is a statistical technique to teach machines to make decisions by showing  them many  examples of correct decisions, or by defining a set of rules and letting the machine learn by  trial and error.  Pedro Domingos , a researcher in ML at University of Washington,  underlines the importance of ML as “learning algorithms […] that make other algorithms”  (Domingos, 2015 [6]). Other core areas of AI -related  research include natural language  processing (NPL), autonomous vehicles and robotics, and computer vision.

Relevance for the public sector   Certain AI approaches such as machine learning (ML)  are already widely visible  in our  daily lives, from a Nest thermostat that learns from user preferences, to Pandora’s music  service that learns to recommend music, Bing’s airfare predictions, Google’s automatic  language translator, or Yelp’s system that helps us ers find a place to eat. As technology  progresses, ML capabilities are likely to improve , possibly adding to future prosperity   (GOV.UK, 2018 [7]) .   This approach  is also true for the public sector, where AI can play a pivotal role in  supporting the public sector  in its perpetual fight to simplify processes  or increase their  efficiency . The increasing demand for services that better answer  to changing user  expectations of r esponsiveness and personalisation , coupled with higher  expectation s on  the role  of the government  in the digital age, requires  a technologica lly mature  public  sector. For example, government should be able to support the application of the “Once  Only Principle”6 as a way to  ease the interaction between citizens and the p ublic  administration. AI and data -driven innovation are supportive elements to bridge this gap.   The current wave of digital transformation in delivering policy and designing services  follows  from the e -government movement which preceded, and informs, it. By enabling  governments to be digital by design, and capable of bring ing the needs of users into  the  development of  policies and services  (OECD, 2014 [8]), a digital government can use AI to  deliver services closer to users’ needs and preferences and thus have the potential to better                                                         6 It aims at ensuring that citizens and businesses provide diverse data only once in contact with  public administrations, while public administration bodies take actions to internally share and reuse  these data – even across borders – always in respect of data protection regulations and other  constraints  (TOOP, 2019 [35]).  
GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13   13    STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use  increase their wellbeing (Welby, 2019 [9]). AI can b e used  to strengthen citizen  engagement   with public institutions; increase operational efficiency  and free up resources for higher  value -adding tasks ; and enable greater predictive capabilities for smarter  policy  making  and service provision .  However, there are still many challenges that governments need to overcome to secure an  effective use of AI , such as data availability, interoperability, standards, and privacy, as  well as security and ethical related issues .  Considering the growing role of AI wit hin public  sectors, i t is key for governments and regulators to review the role they should play to  ensure a balance between encouraging AI to foster public sector innovation and improved  public services, while protecting the public and service users ’ interests from potential  unintended negative consequences of  the use of  these disruptive technologies.    Section 3.3. of the current working paper presents relevant sector s of the government where  the uptake of AI and b lockchain is rapidly taking place, highlig hting the purposes benefits  and challenges linked to the use of these applications  in the public sector .     2.2. Blockchain   What is blockchain   While blockchain exists in many variants, it can be understood as a distributed  ledger  of  transactions that is shared and written by a group of non -trusting  or trusting  parties in a  network, not controlled by a single central authority.   Consider a ledger  that register s and stores all transactions between users in sequential,  chronological order. Instead of one authority controlling this ledger  – like a bank  or an  escrow account  - an identical copy of the ledger is held by all users o f the network  (OECD,  2018 [10]). Content of the transac tions is validated through a consensus mechanism, i.e. a  protocol collectively agreed  on by all network participants, which is verified and secured  through advanced cryptograph y. Blockchain is one type of distributed ledger technology   (Berryhill, Bourgery and Hanson, 2018 [11]).  Several  characteristics of blockchain technology may explain the depth of excitement  people express.  First and foremost , blockchain  provides trust through disintermediation ,  i.e. replace the need for trusted third parties with technology and code . A central  intermediary or governing institution has traditionally been required to establish trust and  mitigate counterparty risk among a set of independent parties that seek to enter in to a  transaction or agreement with each other. While these centralised bodies have effectively  fulfilled their function throughout  large parts of human history, they have at times grown  opaque, complacent, inefficient and costly to run. The risks of censor ship, corruption and  single point of failure have also intensified along side the growing need for digitalisation.   The downsides of centralised control have remained equally acute even into the digital age .  While the internet has vastly improved the flow of  data, it has not changed how business is  done. Intermediaries remain indispensable for transferring assets from peer to peer, which  creates barriers to entry , accumulates wealth within the hands of few and excludes the have nots from the system.   Blockchain can eliminate significant resource burdens by reducing th is dependence on  existing third -party intermediaries and their accompanying layers and costs. It can make  near real -time settlement and verification of transactions . It also heralds the transition from 
14  GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13     STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use the first generation of the Internet to the second generation – from an Internet of information   to an  Internet of value , where individuals and businesses wh ich otherwise have no reason  to trust each other can reach consensus  through direct peer-to-peer collaboration,  cryptography and smart  code (Tapscott and Tapscott, 2016)  (Figure 2.2).  Second, although still in its infancy, if properly designed, blockchain offers the promise of  stronger resilience  against cyberattacks and IT system frauds  than centralised systems ,  thanks to its decentralised nature which prevents single point of failure that is common  to  centralised databases. Security is a built -in design of the technology stack. As information  is replicated simultaneously and kept in sync  on all users of the network, if part of the  network becomes faulty, there will always be another  part that ensures continued  availability of the system.   Third, blockchain is an immutable , censorship -resistant, append -only ledger. The  association of crypto graphy, consensus protocols ( e.g. proof of work/stake/authority, etc.)  and collective/decentralised bookkeeping in principle guarantees that transactions are  recorded irreversibly and permanently. In other words, there can only be one single version  of the  data/information that is visible to all participants in the network , although there is  yet no way of authenticating the veracity of data/information protected in the blockchain .  Some  downside s include lack of sustainability, lack of interoperability,  privacy protection  and the right to be forgotten, hence the general rule is to never register personal information  on blockchain.    Figure 2.2. Moving towards the Internet of value     Source : Deloitte (2017).   Blockchain developments: past and present   Blockchain builds on  several  underlying te chnologies that are  long established in  the space  of computer science and  cybersecurity. Between 1960s and 1980s, cryptographic  foundations were laid with the development o f hash function (a collision -free, and  
GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13   15    STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use  irreversible digital fingerprint ) and public -key or asymmetric cryptography  (a cryptography  system that uses pairs of key) . These early day technologies provided confidentiality in the  transmission of information.   The cypherpunk movement , advocating the use of strong encryption to preserve privacy ,  starting in the early 1990s put concerns of anonymity, privacy and freedom at the heart of  their campaign , and advocated to achieve th ese goals  through widespread use of strong  cryptography and other privacy -enhancing technologies. The 1990s and 2000s  saw early  concepts of anonymous peer-to-peer communication protocols , some of which, such as Tor  and BitTorrent ended up being widely adopted among  cyber communities , and are still used   today . Some core advances behind blockchain technology also occurred during this period,  including the introduction of a computationally practical solution for time -stamping digital  documents and the development of te chnology to more efficiently regroup multiple  documents into one block.   It was not until after the publication of Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper in 2008 that the  world saw the first operational application of blockchain technology. The years 2008 -2013  were marked by the emergence of Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency allowing peer -to-peer  financial transactions without the need of any Central Bank or third -party inter vention . It  was also an era where economies started to shift , slowly but gradually,  from pape r currency  to digital currency.   In 2013, Ethereum was born with added functionalities to go beyond the limitations of  Bitcoin, such as the ability to support smart contracts7 and provide a platform for  developing decentralised applications8 (DApps). This t urned out to be a pivotal moment in  the history of blockchain developments  and spurred  a large number of cryptocurrencies or  blockchain projects built on the Ethereum platform. From  2015 , other second -generation  blockchain platforms , including Tezos, EOS,  IOT, Monero, Zcash,  Lightning Network , to  name a few, have popped up to address challenges of scalability and security associated  with early blockchain applications.   Today, four archetypes of blockchain architecture can be distinguished , classified by acc ess  to transaction validation (validate vs commit) and access to participation in the transactions  (read vs write) (Allessie et al., 2019) . Table 2.1 provides an overview with visualisations.   The fundamental difference between permissionless and permissioned chains is that the  former relies on economic incentive  (e.g. cryptocurrency, tokenomics) to encourage  honest behaviour, since the identity of those validating transactions is typically anonymous;  whereas in the latter, the identity of the validators is known, hence, their desire to protect  their reputation  is what keeps them acting with integrity.                                                             7 These are small computer programmes that automatically execute all or parts of a pre -established  agreement when conditions get fulfilled, and are stored on a blockchain -based platform.   8 DApp runs on decentralised nodes of the network, different from a t raditional app that runs on  centralised servers.

Sourc e: Allessie et al. (2019).   Relevance for the public sector   Blockchain’s features  of security, immutability and disintermediation are relevant to many  functions of government and public administration s. There would be a case to use  blockchain if there is a strong desire to ensure integrity of the data record ( e.g. in case of  elect ronic  voting, public tender , citizen records ) or eliminate dependency upon a third -party  organisation which may not be trustwor thy.    While the most radical innovations are likely to come from public permissionless  blockchain networks, whereby everyone  can see, commit and validate transactions,  companies and governments worldwide have started adopting the technology internally as  a way of saving cost , enhancing operational efficiency  and/or strengthening government  accountability and transparency . Many ongoing experiments are built on permissioned  chains, which may seem most applicable for the public sector  as they allow control to  be  retained over who can record new transactions, all while enhancing accountability through  identity management and transactional transparen cy.   This also implies that less computationally intensive consensus protocols  (such as Proof of  Authority or Roun d robin models)  can be applied  to validate transactions  – with much  higher throughput and instantaneous finality, in case where a large number of parallel  transactions need to be processed simultaneously. Proof of Authority model can also be  more easily ad apted than other models to represent the complexity and multi -stakeholder  nature of government approval and decision -making processes (Box 2.2).   
GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13   17    STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use  Box 2.2. Proof of Authority protocol for the public sector   Proof of Authority provides the ability to validate and publish new blocks to the Blockchain  for authorised users, called validators. Unlike consensus models like Proof of Work and  Proof of Stake, a user’s identity must be known and verified. This is critical, as identity is  the sole ver ification of a user’s authority to add new blocks to the chain. When compared  with Proof of Work, Proof of Authority is a much faster model for processing new blocks,  as there is no need for lengthy and resource intensive computer processing.   The logic wit h this model is, “Individuals whose identity (and reputation by extension) is  at stake for the securing of a network are incentivised to preserve the network” (POA  Network, 2017). This consensus model may seem the most familiar to users who have  experience  working with databases in which only specific authorised users may edit or add  data to a database. Thus, it may be the most applicable for many applications of Blockchain  technologies in the public sector, as it can be adapted to represent the complexity of  government review and decision -making processes (Marchionni, 2017).   To adapt the PoA model to a government ecosystem an extension must be defined. A new  consensus mechanism called Distributed Proof of Authority (D -PoA) has been proposed  where the Authority is not anymore applied overall but, as the chain itself, is distrib uted  and flexibly adapted to the various authoritative areas constituting the government  ecosystem.   D-PoA extends PoA through the following concepts:   1. Nodes must be ‘grouped’ in ‘Areas of Authority’ (AoA) where all nodes within  one area can only mine bloc ks and run contracts related to that area (e.g. Health  Area of Authority)   2. Nodes within an area of authority can be added with a process involving only the  nodes already authoritative for that area.   3. Nodes within their own area of Authority can sign any nu mber of blocks belonging  to that area of authority.   4. One node can belong to multiple Areas of Authority   5. There is one Central Master Node acting as Node Management Process Supervisor   Naturally, such extension requires a complex implementation of the conse nsus mechanism  that implies extensive development of the protocol with clear advantages from a  governance point of view, but also with some disadvantages linked to its complexity.

Major trend s in AI and blockchain technology adoption in public sector    The digital transformation of governments has progressed through three phases  (OECD,  2019 b):   Analogue government : closed operations and internal focus, analogue procedures;    E-government : digitisation of existing government processes and online delivery  of public services through the use of information and communication technologies  (ICTs), particularly the Internet;    Digital government : the use of digital technologies and data (including big data)  to transform the design and implementation process of public policies and services  in order to achieve more open and citizen -driven approaches .  Drawing on insights collected through a questionnaire , this section illustrate s recent  trends  in the adoption of AI and blockchain technologies in the public sector s of the 20 Thematic  Group (TG) countries . Specifically, it : review s the presence of national strateg ies and main  actors tasked with advancing the digital government agenda (section 3.1); gauge s the level  of government support  and classif y the roles it plays  for encouraging public sector uptake  of these technologies  (section 3.2); and , maps the main areas of public sector adoption   (section 3.3).    The OECD AI Recommendation, adopted in May 2019 , is the first international standards  agreed by governments for the re sponsible stewardship of trustworthy AI. Beyond OECD  Members, other countries including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru and  Romania have adhered to the AI Principles . In June 2019, the G20 adopted human -centred  AI Principles  that draw from the OECD AI Principles , as well as the Ministerial Statement  on Trade and Digital Economy.  The OECD Principles on AI include concrete  recommendations for public policy and strategy.   Box 3.1. The OECD AI Recommendation   The Recommendation identifies five complementary values -based principles for the  responsible stewardship of trustworthy AI:    AI should benefit people and the planet by driving inclusive growth, sustainable  development and well -being.    AI systems should be designed in a way that respects the rule of law, human rights,  democratic v alues and diversity, and they should include appropriate safeguards –  for example, enabling human intervention where necessary – to ensure a fair and  just society.    There should be transparency and responsible disclosure around AI systems to  ensure that peo ple understand AI -based outcomes and can challenge them.    AI systems must function in a robust, secure and safe way throughout their life  cycles and potential risks should be continually assessed and managed.  
GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13   19    STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use   Organisations and individuals developing, deploy ing or operating AI systems  should be held accountable for their proper functioning in line with the above  principles.   Consistent with these value -based principles, it provides five recommendations to  governments:    Facilitate public and private investment i n research and development to spur  innovation in trustworthy AI.    Foster accessible AI ecosystems with digital infrastructure and technologies and  mechanisms to share data and knowledge.    Ensure a policy environment that will open the way to deployment of tr ustworthy  AI systems.    Empower people with the skills for AI and support workers for a fair transition.    Co-operate across borders and sectors to progress on responsible stewardship of  trustworthy AI.   According to the OECD Recommendation, AI should contribute to inclusive and  sustainable growth and well -being . Second, it should be used in ways that respect human centred values and fairness . Third , the use of AI and how its systems operate should be  transparen t. Fourth, AI systems should be robust and  safe. Fifth, there should be  accountability for the results of AI predictions and the ensuing  decisions. Such measures  are viewed as critical for high -stakes predictions . They are also important in business  recommendations or for less impactful uses of AI .  National policies are needed to promote trustworthy AI systems. Such policies can spur  beneficial and fair outcomes for people and for the planet, especially in promising areas  underserved by market -driven investments. The creation of an enabling policy environment  for trustworthy AI includes, among other things, facilitating public and private investment  in AI research and development and equipping people with the skills necessary to succeed  as work evolves.   3.1. A diverse approach in building ET nation al strategies and governing bodies in  the public sector   All 20  TG countries  have announced national strategies and policy initiatives to advance  the digital transformation of their econom ies and societ ies, including that of the digital  government agenda . The majority of t hese strategies  and initiatives  dedicate a section to  the development of data-driven  and citizen -centred government . A few , including  Canada,   Chile,  Estonia , Italy, Netherlands,  New Zealand, the UK and Uruguay  have devised  or are  currently developing  targeted  plans for moving from e-government towards digital  government.   These strategic documents  commonly aim to achieve greater efficiency , transparency  and  accountability in the way administrative  services are delivered; enhance interoperability   of the state information system  to break silos and bolster efficiency in work processes; and  increase the use of data and analytics  in policy and decision -making  so as to better  anticipate and respond to the changing needs of citizens  and businesses. While there is  generally continued emphasis on paperless administration, open data and govern ment , the 
20  GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13     STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use more digitally advanced countries , such as Estonia, have set up ambitious (sometimes  numerical) targets on aspects including: quality and user satisfaction of public digital  services; uptake of emerging technolog ies in public sector; security and resilience of the  state information infrastructure; and the level of digital knowledge and skills among public  sector employees.   Four  pillars of actions are typically mentioned  to achieve these goals :    Government as a platform  to foster more u ser-driven service design and  delivery : continue pursuing higher integration and interoperability of systems,  expand access t o and use of common key enablers (e.g. digital identity) or  harmonise public sector data to streamline various user -facing procedures  and  break down organisational silos for more collaborative governments.     Data -driven public sector and op en data :  continu e to promote public sector  information disclosure , strengthen personal data protection,  and enable the  participation of citizens and non -governmental stakeholders in decision -making  process;    Digital capability : strengthen digital literacy  (i.e. the use of data, analytics and IT  tools)  and talent attraction within the public sector , through training , reskilling,  lifelong education  and rethinking job profiling ;   Technology and infrastructure : develop trusted and secure  connectivity  infrastructure ( e.g. broadband and 5G coverage) that underpins all activities of the  digital economy and digital government , raise cyber security standards  and  implement IT modernisation including through innovative procurement practices   and encouraging open source .  Reference s to specific types of  technologies  are not systematically included, but when they  do, these have shifted from cloud -based solutions , social media, web or mobile applications  that dominated the strategies developed during the first half of the 2010s  (OECD 2003,  2005, 2009, 2011) , to advanced analytics, AI , blockchain  and Internet of Things in more  recently drafted documents.   Additionall y, most of the TG countries have devised national strategies specific to the  development of AI technology, many of which i nclude a focus on promoting its  introduction in public sector , with the aim of making public service delivery more efficient,  convenient and inclusive.  On the other hand, none of the TG countries , with the exception  of Italy,  have so far introduced  overarc hing documents on blockchain technology, de spite  a growing number of government -led use case pilots, working groups and policy papers.  The Italian Simplification  decree of 2019 introduces the regulatory definition of  technologies based on distributed regis ters (blockchain) and smart contracts. The decree  also provides that the storage of an electronic document through the use of technologies  based on distributed registers produces the legal effects of electronic time validation.   As key actors are concerned , the majority of the TG countries have created, or assigned  responsibility to, a specific entity within the central administration for managing the overall  coordination and implementation of the digital government agenda. Typically, these  entities are eit her permanent structures coordinating actions among different arms of the  administration, or ad hoc  teams dedicated to fostering the uptake of emerging technologies   across the public sector.

The Argentinian Secretary of Government of Science and Technology launched within the Digital  Agenda the “National Plan of Artificial Intelligence”. The plan seeks to position the country as a  regional leader in the field, and maximi se the generation and u se of knowledge with the ultimate goal  of improving the competitiveness of the private sector and moderni sing the management of the State  to provide better services to citizens. It includes participation of all relevant actors : academia, civil  society and private sector.   2. Australia does not have a specific AI strategy, but its “Digital Transformation Strategy” includes  emerging technologies, such as AI.  To make government smarter through AI and data by 2025, its  strategic objectives include the use of data a nalytics to shape and form all public policies. Agencies  are expected to use and reuse public sector data through data integration and a federated approach to  data and all services will be personalised and enriched using AI and advanced analytics.   3. Canada has drafted  a “Pan -Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy” to retain and attract top  academic talent, and increase the number of postgraduate trainees and researchers studying AI and  deep learning.  The Strategy aims to promote collaboration among Canada’ s main centres of expertise  in Montréal, Toronto -Waterloo and Edmonton, and position Canada as a world -leading destination  for companies seeking to innovate through the application of AI. It is important to note that the  Strategy focuses on developing rese arch and development capacity more broadly across the economy  and society, not public sector capacity specifically. Along with that, Canada has an AI strategy  specifically for public sector: the Treasury Board has released a white paper  which examines the  policy, technical, ethical and legal considerations around the use of this technology within the  Government of the Canada  (Karlin, 2018 [12]). Its primary objective is to assist federal institutions by   providing recommendations on how to implement these systems.   4. The Chilean Ministry of Economy  set up public -private working tables in 2018 to explore  opportunities for the use blockchain technology in six areas: Digital Identity, Commerce, Financial  Servic es, Registration Systems, Energy and Health. The objective was to generate a technical  document, to review the context of each area, identify international success experiences and explore  possible blockchain projects to develop in Chile  (Carrión, 2017 [13]).  5. In May 2017, Finland’s Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment created an Artificial  Intelligence Programme and a Steering Group to ensure its guidance. The group leveraged a broad  network of exp erts to explore key questions about how best to support the public and private sectors  in producing AI -based innovation, how to position government data as resources for economic  development, how AI will affect society and what the public sector should do to move Finland  towards an AI -driven future. As a consequence of this work, the Steering Group issued two key  reports that set forth Finland’s approach to AI. Finland’s Age of Artificial Intelligence117 (December  2017) and Leading the Way into the Age of A rtificial Intelligence (June 2019) collectively lay out 11  key actions covering all sectors to help Finland achieve its ambitious goal . For the public sector, the  Age of AI report calls for the government to establish Aurora, a network of different smart s ervices  and applications to “allow the public administration to better anticipate and provide resources for  future service needs” and to allow citizens to access high -quality 24/7 digital services.  Since the initial  concept for Aurora was released, it has been expanded significantly into the AuroraAI National AI  Programme. AuroraAI seeks to provide a holistic set of personalised AI -driven services for citizens  and businesses in a way that is human -centric and works towards their wellbeing as its ultimate go al.   6. The Italian “Artificial Intelligence Task Force” released a white paper  to analyse the impact of AI  on our society and, specifically, how these technologies can be used by the public sector to improve  services for citizens and businesses (AGID, 2018 [14]). The White Paper also includes  recommendations on how to use or introduce AI solution in the public sector.  In 2019 the Ministry  of Economic Development launched the National Strategy on AI with a focus on the use of AI at  national level, with a clear view on the application of AI to the Sustainable Development Goals.   7. The Latvian “Data Driven Nation Memorandum (DDN) ” focused on data accessibility, cloud  computing, the development of the open data portal, the establishment of public -private partnerships  for the development of new data -driven products and for society’s inclusion in decision making  process.   8. Mexico does not have an official national strategy on AI, although a white paper entitled “Towards  an AI Strategy in Mexico: Harnessing the AI Revolution” was prepared in January 2018 by the  Government of Mexico, together with Oxford Insights, C -Minds, the Mexica n Society for Artificial

Based on its digital strategy, the Netherlands pl ans to develop agendas for specific areas, such as the  National Cyber Security Agenda.   10. In New Zealand, the next iteration of the government digital strategy will address emerging  technologies along with other aspects of the evolving digital environment. Th e New Zealand’s  government has also cosponsored  a number of reports on the current state of emerging technologies  to provide recommendations for relevant uptake, most notably the AI Forum’s “Artificial  Intelligence: Shaping a Future New Zealand”.   11. The Found ation for Science and Technology (FCT), a public agency under the Portuguese Ministry  of Science, Technology and Higher Education, is tasked with preparing the National Strategy for AI.   12. In 2017, the UK government published two  other reports related to tec hnology  innovation,  respectively “Growing the  artificial intelligence industry in the UK ” and  “Delivering better outcomes  for citizens:  practical s teps for unlocking public value ”. The second report posits that incremental  and  disruptive innovation should lead to  public value creation and efficiencies  procuring marginal gains.   13. Uruguay’s “Digital Government Strategy 2020” defines the objectives and guidelines that encourage  the country’s digital transformation. Its structure proposes a holistic vision of Dig ital Government  composed of six areas of actions, each with a set of target objectives and goals. “Intensive use of data  and emerging technologies” is one of the main objectives under the Smart Government area.   “Tecnologías Emergentes” (ET) is a specific department within Agesic's techno logy area whose main  tasks are:   - To research, develop and promote the use of innovative and emerging technologies that contribute  to the creation of value and facilitate effective management in Sta te organizations   - Analyz e and disseminate methodologies, good practices and innovative IT solutions that enhance  the digita l transformation of government.   - Generate proofs of concept on emerging and innovative IT solutions that guide the selection of  technologies to be applied i n digital transformation projects.   14. In addition to the national strategies, the European Commission  (EC)  is actively promoting emerging  technologies at the EU  level. In particular, the EC :   o Issued “Data Package”  in April 2018 , an initiative that puts forward a set of measures to  increase the availability of data in the EU , with the ultimate goal of building a European  data economy;   o Outlined  a European approach in April 2018 to boost investment , set ethical guidelines in  AI and establish a High -Level  Group on AI along with  a European AI alliance. In December  2018, the EC and Member States published the “Coordinated action plan on the  development of AI in the EU 18”  to promote the development of AI in Europe. The action  plan recognises: 1) the need for a ll European countries to work together to make the most  of the opportunities offered by AI and become a world leader in this crucial technology for  the future; 2) the prominent role of ethical matters in this area; 3) the required collaboration  between the  European Commission and Member States to address the new challenges  brought by AI. The action plan also outlines measures of AI for the public sector, such as  joint procurement and translations. As regards AI and ethics, the AI HLEG released  the  “Ethics g uidelines for trustworthy AI” in April  2019;   o Launched an EU blockchain observatory  in February 2018  to highlight key developments  of this technology, promote European actors and reinforce European engagement with  multiple stakeholders involved in blockchai n activities . Further,  the European Blockchain  Partnership  (EBP) was established in June 2018 , as a vehicle for promoting cooperation  amongst  EU member states  to exchange experience and expertise and prepare for the launch  of EU -wide blockchain application s across the Digital Single Market , for the benefit of the  public and private sectors. In 2019, the EC in cooperation with the EBP and other  stakeholders will initiate the creation of European Blockchain Services Infrastructure  (EBSI) , to deploy the first set of cross -border digital public services.

Growing public support  to encourage research and application   Both AI and blockchain are general purpose technologies with the potential to impact a  wide range of economic and social activities . Governments can play multiple roles to  strengthen national research capacity and help translate technological progress into public  and private sector applications. This section reviews  the size and forms of government  support for encouraging research and  application of AI and blockchain in public sector   among the TG countries . It has identified three roles that governments can play   simultaneously : as a financier  or direct investor , as a smart buyer and co-developer , and as  a regulator  or rules maker .  Gove rnment  as a financier  or direct investor   Governments can provide funding to support the development and adoption of emerging  technologies , and by doing so, can prioritise areas of public benefit that would be under served by the private sector . While there  is no systematic statistical review of the size and  forms of government funding  for public sector adoption  of AI and blockchain, a number of  funding schemes related to call for projects or pilot tenders have been identified . Table 3.2  summarises these programmes  and provides a tentative and partial indication of the scope  of public support in TG countries . The figures presented are  non-exhaustive estimates, are  not directly comparable across countries , and generally include support for pre-commercial  R&D projects  whose outcomes may apply to the economy  at large and not the  public sector  alone.

In Italy  the National Innovation Fund (FNI), established as a public venture capital by the  Ministry of Economic Development, has a starting budget, foreseen in the 2019 Bu dget  Law, of about 1 billion euro , aims to bring together and multiply public and private  resources dedicated to the strategic theme of innovation.    An interesting example of Portugal is the annual competitive call for projects organised by  the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology under the National Digital  Competency Initiative, “Portugal INCoDe.2030 ”. The Foundation has rolled out a  “Programme in Data Science and AI in Public Administration” through open  tenders to  support R&D projects aimed at improving the analysis of large amounts of data available  in the public administration, in order to improve the provision of public services and assist  decision -making processes with better evidence.   In Uruguay organised  in 2019 the second  Artificial Intelligence (AI) event: IA -ckaton  2019, "Artificial Intelligence to improve public services".   The objective of the IA-ckaton  is to generate, define and develop innovative projects that  improve State services supported by this technology. In addition to promoting  experimentation and the development of the best projects in IA, the activity seeks to 
30  GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13     STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use encourage entrepreneurship and collaborative work in an environment of healthy   competition.   In this edition, the activity is supported by the Electronic Government Network of Latin  America and the Caribbean (Red Gealc), which brings together the Digital Government  authorities of the countries of the region and aims to support Digita l Government policies  that place citizens and, in particular, the most vulnerable populations at the center of their  work.   Government  as a smart buyer  and co-developer   With funding schemes established, the next step for governments to undertake is to ident ify  viable projects and meaningful use cases to experiment with . ICT procurement or digital  sourcing is an important part of the public sector value chain, supplying goods and services  integrated in many parts of the public service delivery.   Governments c an act as a smart buyer  of existing solutions through innovative  procurement practices, or as a co-developer  through public -private partnerships (PPP) and  other forms of collaboration to build new or tailored solutions. Governments can drive  innovation fro m the demand side by steering the development of new solutions directly  towards its needs, or to better respond to users’ needs. An innovative approach is precommercial procurement . This involves  public administration s procur ing new services  or products that are still at a pre -commercial stage of research and development by  sharing  the risks and benefits of design, prototyping and testing with private sector suppliers.   Based on responses from 22 OECD countries to a 2014 survey on Digital Government  Perfor mance , half of the countries surveyed have a strategy in place specifically targeting  ICT procurement, whether it exists within selected line ministries, across the central  government or across different levels of government ( OECD Dataset on Digital  Govern ment Performance) . Risk aversion  is however frequently observed in the  procurement practices of digital technologies.  Two thirds of the surveyed countries  prioritise procuring standardised ICT solutions over tailored business needs, with an equal  share of countries preferring to purchase proven technologies rather than exploring untested  innovative approaches ( OECD Dataset on Digital Government Performance ).   Countries are evenly divided on where to draw the balance between achieving economi es  of scale (hen ce best value for the public sector) and stimulating innovation when making a  digital procurement decision. Many IT projects in government and public services are  extremely large, complex and monolithic, and often require partnering with top -tier IT  servic e providers capable o f undertak ing far-reaching  and transformational projects.  However, this may encourage rent -seeking behaviour around proprietary software and  possibly open the door to public sector dependency on these suppliers and a situation of  techn ological lock -in.  Governments worldwide have started to update procurement and contracting rules to better  source innovation to support the digital transformation in the public sector , all while  diversifying the sources of suppliers . An emerging good practice has been the introduction  of digital marketplace , which has the potential to transform how government can work as  a single customer  and make it simpler , faster and more cost efficient for a wider range of  market actors to access industry innovation. Several TG countries, such as Australia,  Estonia, New Zealand, the UK , have introduced  a digital marketplace to allow more  flexible and agile procurement processes and reduce agency silos.  
GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13   31    STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use  An important objective of these marketplace s has been to reduce barriers for smaller and   potentially  local businesses by giving them a leg up when competing for lucrative public  sector contracts, thereby  levelling a playing field that has traditionally been dominated by  large, top tier international  suppliers . The experience of the UK has shown early signs of  success. Since its launch in 2014, the UK Digital Marketplace has seen over £4.3 billion  worth of contracts pass through it, with just under half of that going to small and medium sized  enterprises (OECD, 2018). This, compared to 2009, when fewer than twenty  companies retained 80% of the UK’s £16 billion of annual IT spending, is a first step  towards supporting broader -based growth of the digital sector, particularly for start -ups and  scale-ups. In addition to the Digital Marketplace, in 2019 the UK government launched  SPARK , a new marketplace for innovation that provides a smarter way for public sector  customers to access the very latest technologies.   There are also expected benefits fo r the public sector, notwithstanding the perception of  being open for business and competition and a start of cultural  and behavioural  change  towards more experimentation and calculated risk -taking, both of which are  essential   qualities and mind -sets for d riving the adoption of emerging technologies in the public  sector .  Italy  has launched the innovative procurement portal to favor the emergence, qualification  and aggregation of innovation needs of public  administrations;  contribute to the  dissemination of knowledge, by the administrations, of the methods and tools to carry out  projects and procurement of innovation;  to involve the market as widely as possible,  channeling it towards the knowledge of innovative public demand and stimulating the  proposition of  the best possible solutions in a logic of open innovation;  and to favor the  meeting between the demand and the offer of innovative solutions, encouraging an  effective collaboration between PA, companies and research bodies, in line with the  provisions of the national  Digital Agenda.   Meanwhile, governments are playing a more proactive role in building digital solutions  alongside academia and industry . At times, governments have also operated in “start -up”  mode , where experiments with new technologies are deployed, evaluated and modified,  and then scaled up or down, or abandoned quickly . A growing number of public sector  applications of emerging technologies are  promoted via the implementation of Proof of  Concept (PoC) that aim at confirming the feasibilit y of some idea before prototyping  potential solutions. For instance, the European Commission launched  a few PoCs over the  course of 2018 , targeting different thematic areas ranging from semantic analysis, detection  and identification of document insights, image recognition to development of chatbots,  fraud detection, macro socio -environmental -economic scenarios.  Italy  has launched two  platforms for design ( https://designers.italia.it/ ) and development  (https:// developers.italia.it/)  of public digital services. Designers Italia is the point of  reference for the design of the Public Administration: guides, work tools and a forum to  foster collaboration between designers and strengthen the role of design in the dev elopment  of public services.  Developers Italia is a collaborative community open to everyone's  contribution: public administrators, developers, technicians and ordinary citizens. It was  created to create a more open and more evolved digital Italy.  Governme nts around the  world are also hosting hackathons to source innovative ideas for solving pain points in  public services delivery or policy formulation.    Over the past few years, t he popularisation of  a design thinking  approach  in the public  sector  has furth er boosted governments’ ability to think outside the box when delivering  public value using new technologies. Originally developed and used by designers, 
32  GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13     STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use architects and the private sector , design thinking is a creative problem -solving process that  puts the  user at the centre of attention  (UNDP, 2014) . It results from an iterative process of  listening to end -users and engaging them in co -shaping decisions (professional empathy  and co -creation); considering the multiple causes, dimensions and size of the prob lems at  hand (scaling); and experimenting with initial ideas to gain first -hand feedback (ideation,  prototyping and testing)  (Figure 3.1). Such a non -linear approach stimulates creative  thinking within the decision -making process and has been increasingly applied to concrete  public service delivery projects.   Figure 3.2. Design thinking: A non -linear approach      Source of visual : interaction -design.org   Government  as a regulator or rules maker    Accelerated innov ation cycles of the emerging technologies call for rethinking the types of  policy and regulatory instruments used and their implementation. Digitalisation challenges  the rationale for traditional approaches to the design, enforcement and governance of  regulation. As both an enabler and a user of emerging digital technologies, governments  are facing the challenge of how to regulate them to maximise their innovative potential  while minimi sing the risks for end users , in a number of areas such as privacy, security ,  safety, cross -border data flows  and employment . The diversity of challenges raised by  digital transformation will require  a holistic, whole -of-government approach to ensure  coher ence across policy objectives , as well as regulatory co -operation between countries to  address transboundary challenges of digitalisation  (OECD, 2019d).   Governments can use  regulatory sandboxes, innovation centres and policy labs to provide  controlled envi ronment s in which emerging technologies  can be tested.  For instance,  Argentina is in the process of establishing a national AI Innovation Hub  to implement  projects in various  thematic group s, each of which will be governed by  a steering group  charged with defining goals and metrics to measure progress .   Approaches to ensure rapid and agile policy responsiveness include p olicy experiments that  operate in “start -up mode” where by experiments are deployed, evaluated and modified, and  then scaled up or down, or abandoned quickly  (OECD, 2018) . Using digital tools to design  policy and monitor targets is another option to spur faster and more effective decision making  (OECD, 2018) . For instance, some governments use “agent -based modelling” to  anticipate the impact of policy variants on different types of businesses  or use cases   (OECD, 2019c) . Based on the OECD AI Recommendation, the OECD is currently  
GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13   33    STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use  developing practical guidance to promote its impleme ntation in countries. This will include  concrete guidance for implementing the recommendation on “shaping an enabling policy  environment for AI”.   3.3. Mapping uptake  of AI and blockchain  in the public sector   Governments in the 20 TG countries are current ly experimenting with and implementing  projects aimed at exploiting emerging digital  technologies to better meet the needs of  public -service users and steward their resources . These projects  increasingly centre around  the applications of AI technology, and  more recently of blockchain to a lesser extent. They  fall under four broad  areas  (Table 3.3):   Enhancing the quality of citizen -facing welfare services ;   Increasing operational efficiency and security ;   Preserving the environment, natural capital and  climate  resilience ;   Making data-driven  policy decisions for better governance .  This section will highlight a few areas in the public sector that are seeing widespread or  rapid uptake of AI and blockchain technologies; illustrate the benefits and purposes of these   applications; and present  a list of initiatives and concrete examples undertaken by the TG  countries.

38  GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13     STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use AI applications and benefits   There are many promising  uses of AI for governments and public sector organisations . If  correctly designed and implemented , automation tools could be used  to enhance the  efficiency  and quality  of many public sector procedures, offering citizens the opportunity  to interact with the state in more agile, effective and personalised way s.  More and more  government agencies are considering or starting to use AI technology to  provide a human -centric  interf ace that supports more user -driven service design that  best  meets the needs of users.  Areas involving citizen engagement and social welfare services   are seeing an increasing number of AI application experiments. An important driver behind  this adoption is to offer citizens a more pleasant  and satisfactory experience in  their  interactions with the public sector , for instance reduce wait times , provide 24x7 and  customised support, and increase accuracy of responses. As such, AI is being deployed , for  instance  through robotic s and cognitive automation , to answer questions, query databases,  process documents, fill in forms, translate texts and correctly route requests (Mehr,  2017 [15]).   These process automation technologies also represent a near -term opportunity for  governments to increase productivity , slash  paperwork burdens, keep costs down  and  overcome resource constraints , particularly in terms of  optimising workforce and shifting  civil se rvants to more complex, value -adding tasks.  As an illustration, according to a 2017  study by Deloitte, out of the 4.3 billion hours worked per year in the US federal  government, between 96.7 million hours and 1.2 billion hours could be freed up by  automati on, with potential savings ranging from $3.3 billion at the low end, to $41.1 billion  at the high end (Deloitte, 2017).   While in general terms, the initial role of AI in government has been to automate repetitive  tasks , the technology can also be integrate d into the entire policy making process  to  enhance predictive capabilities  for better decision making and policy outcomes.  There is  a growing trend for experimenting with the use of machine learning  and other cognitive  technologies for collecting better informed data sets in a much faster and scalable manner,  and for analysing data to uncover patterns and make predictions  to enable early  intervention, fine -tune policy mix and optimise resource allocation . For example, AI  technologies may  allow for more accurate fraud detection in areas such as taxation and  social benefits claims; e arly identification of outbreaks and surveillance of disease  spreading; and improved  law enforcement for better prevention of crimes and increased  public securi ty (OECD, 2019).    Three  main areas of AI applications are discussed below :  Health care  The latest advances in computer  vision  technology are proving crucial for diagnostics in  healthcare as it is based on pattern recognition. Countless algorithms are curre ntly trained  to detect and classify patterns seen in medical images that contain large, real -time and high resolution data sets. Combin ed with the  efforts of doctors, some  machine learning models   can already drastically reduce human error rates and accurat ely predict the probability of a  medical condition , such as heart disease and some types of skin and breast cancers.  Predictive tools can further  assess the risks that a disease could evolve , which will be  particularly useful for infectious diseases that a ccount for a large percentage of healthcare  expenditures. AI could rapidly track, analyse and diagnose various infectious processes in 
GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13   39    STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use  real time, and assist hospitals and healthcare authorities in creating better mechanisms for  pattern tracking and disease  prevention.   Besides being used as a diagnostic tool, AI -enhanced technologies also prove to be a  powerful ally to improve patient care and outcomes , in both clinical and home care  environments . Research into robots tak ing care of patients is producing inn ovative results.   Consumer devices such as wearables, voice assistants and mobile technologies also allow  for direct and remote monitoring of patients’ conditions and personalised intervention  along the care continuum.   Although medicine is not the first field to embrace machine learning , it represents a more  complex environment for its implementation due to the heightened stakes and downstream  effects in comparison to other scientific disciplines. In 2018, worldwide spending on  cognitive and AI systems is  predicted to reach $19.1 billion, a 54.2% increase compared  with the previous year.  In the healthcare sector , most of the $1.7 billion annual investment  will be spent on R&D into diagnosis and treatment systems  (IDC, 2017 [16]). This is in line  with 2016’s market analysis that  predicted the growth of AI in healthcare from $0.6 billion  in 2014 to $6.7 billion by 2021  (Frost and Sullivan, 2015 [17]).   This data provides a striking picture of the magnitude of AI growth and its impending  impact. In the short term, AI developments and applications in healthcare will focus on the  automation of rote and labour -intensive tasks  such as analysis of medical imaging  and then  move toward a more quantitative approach providing reliable metrics on disease and  response to therapy  that can provide  patient -tailored medicine. In the long run, AI will  likely shift from the simple task -oriented application to more advanced quantification  parameters, focusing on patient management, best standard of care, and prognostication.   As the role of AI in healthcare matures it will consequently improve resource allocation  and access to care, especiall y in emerging economies where general access to healthcare  and speciali sed medical assistance are limited.   Transportation   As with healthcare, there are multiple applications of AI in transportation. One of the most  transformational shifts has been with the transition to autonomous (self -driving) vehicles  powered by AI. Whilst driverless vehicles have now logged thousands of hours of  autonomous driving, a number of high -profile  accident s have shown that th e technology   cannot yet permit full autonomy in complex environments.   However, it is not just in taking over responsibility for the driving of a vehicle that AI can  add value. AI can play a role in driver assistance systems, safety systems and collision  avoidance sys tems as well as in the routing of public transport and managing of transport  infrastructure (ICTC, 2015 [18]). AI solutions have been frequently applied to predict and  detect traffic accidents and condi tions, including by converting traffic sensors to intelligent  agents using came ras. In the near future, AI is expected to significantly impact urban  infrastructure by providing accurate predictive behavioural passenger analytics, which will  feed in the dev elopment of traffic demand modelling, support systems for transportation  planning as well as the allocation of new construction and maintenance and rehabilitation  budget (Stanford, 2016).   Security  and safety   The security sector  in its broad definition (phy sical, environmental and digital)  can benefit  from the development of AI technologies. For instance, in the field of surveillance , 
40  GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13     STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use computer vision and natural language processing systems can process large amounts of  images, texts and speeches, to detect po ssible threats  to public safety and order  in real time.   Law enforcement agencies can also use similar technologies to patrol cities, relying on  continuously updated data linked to crimes committed in various areas and to other  significant variables.  Facial  recognition technologies have proven particularly relevant in  streamlining criminal investigations, detect crimes at early stages and counter terrorism.     In the field of environmental disaster prevention, it is possible to perform natural  phenomena simu lations that can help authorities decide when and how to intervene. AI  systems can be trained with historical and real -time data to forecast the occurrence of  extreme weather, provide early warning of natural catastrophes such as earthquakes, floods,  volcanic eruptions and hurricanes, build damage predictions and support the construction  of disaster -ready infrastructure. A 2018 report of the World Economic Forum  (WEF)   further illustrates 80 existing AI use cases for meeting critical environmental challenges,  from climate change, biodiversity and conservation, healthy oceans, to water security, clean  air and weather and disaster resilien ce (WEF, 2018) .   Blockchain applications and benefits   Despite the hype -hope debate around blockchain and cryptocurrency over the past two  years, the technology is increasingly considered one of the most innovative approaches in  the new paradigm of digital government. By August 2017, over 200 blockchain -related  initiatives had been launched or planned in at least 46 countries around the world (The  Illinois Blockchain Initiative database). These initiatives include both practical pilots and  communities of pra ctice and partnerships to share lessons learnt across countries, regions  and sectors.   A recent  study by the EU Joint Research Centre assessed seven pioneering blockchain  implementations in public services and found that current experiments of blockchain i n  public sector  have largely continued to follow a mostly centralised governance logic, where  the government retains a vast amount of the decision -making power (Allessie et al., 2019).  Interestingly, there is always some level of restriction reserved for p ublic sector players ,  either on who can commit transactions in the system or on who can validate transactions.  This is perhaps unsurprising given that  disintermediation (or the removal of central , trusted  third -party organisations ) is considered by many as  the most disruptive innovation of  blockchain, particularly public permissionless chains, but none of the projects studied aim  at direct disintermediation of any of the public institutions involved in the provision of  governmental functions .  Nevertheless, there are still significant incremental benefits that can be reaped  in the near  term through the use of  blockchain in the provision of public services. Two sets of benefits  emerge : one relates to increased transparency and security  through the enhancement of  data integrity, immutability and consistency across agencies; the other concerns efficiency  gains  resulting from the reduction of  processing time and costs  thanks to smart contract  automation  (Allessie et al., 2019).   In economies where third -parties are not always trustworthy and public trust in government  runs low  – typically  due to protracted history of perceived corruption  – a significant benefit  of blockchain systems would be in the strong support they provide for immutability and  non-repudiation.  By storing information in multiple copies maintained and synchronised  by independent nodes in a peer -to-peer network  that is beyond the sole control of a central  entity , blockchain can provide higher level s of security and integrity of the data records  than most centralised systems stand to offer. By so doing, it strengthens public trust in 
GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13   41    STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use  governmental processes and recordkeeping, and increases reliability and accountability of  the public sector organisations that issue, notarise or store these records  – from citizens’  birth and civil rights certificates, academic degrees, to electronic health records and asset  registers. The use of distributed ledgers and smart contracts will also limit discretionary  power and corruption.   On the other hand , public trust in government tends to be higher in developed societies  with  sound governance of rule of law and  robust checks and balances.  The benefits of using  blockchain would more likely arise from innovative ways of public service delivery and  interaction models, wh ich will reduce the cost, time and complexity in public -private  information exchanges. For example, smart contracts  can be deployed to determine and  govern the times at which social aid would be granted, a s well as the  conditions under  which it must contin ue or stop. Citizens could experience efficiency gains and economic  benefits from th ese more agile and personalised ways  of citizen -state interaction s. Besides,  new models of democratic participation empowered by blockchain, such as futarchy,  quadratic vot ing, liquid democracy and holographic consensus, also hold potential to  increase citizens’ ownership over democratic processes  (Buterin, 2014; Allen et al., 2017 ;  Buterin et al., 2018; Kotsialou and Riley, 2017 ).    Furthermore, d istributed IT solution s have emerged as a more effective approach to  improve  interoperability and efficiency  in inter- and intragovernmental processes .  Governments can use blockchain as an information infrastructure for timely and reliable  inter- and intragovernmental exchange of  information. The architectural set -up of  blockchain is in line with the “Once -Only Principle ” and can bring operational efficiency  by breaking organisational IT silos among public agencies (Allessie et al., 2019). The idea  is to create  a Government Servic e Blockchain that allows  for mutualisation of data in a  secure and flexible way without imposing unified process and technology stacks to all  involved entities. This can be achieved through the decentrali sation of the service and the  usage of smart contrac ts using the blockchain as a kind of “asynchronous communication  bus” (Marchionni, 2018 [19]).  Common use cases for blockchain in the public sector , although still a niche and  experimental,  have so far included digital identity and certificates (credentials, licenses and  attestations), personal records (health and credit data), welfare benefits or entitlements,  asset registries (land titles), digital currenc ies and payments (Central Bank issu ed), inter -  or intragovernmental transactions, data integration, and supply chain traceability. They  generally leverage three core business values of blockchain: recordkeeping  and  authentication , value transfer, and smart contracts (Deloitte, 2017a).  The f ollowing will  briefly present four such examples.   Identity management   One fifth of the world’s population today still live without a legal or officially recognised  identity (World Bank, 2017). Besides, individuals and organisations are often not in control   over their own identities. Theft of personal information is common, leaving centralised data  systems vulnerable to hackers. Further, i dentity management has long suffered from   differing attestation processes and entry points that prevent economic manageme nt and  seamless , secure  and scalable  inter-agency sharing of data. Blockchain could be used to  establish secure, self -sovereign digital identities for citizens and businesses  and enable  efficient transactions across a wide variety of activities. Users can also have individual and  secure  control over which identity elements are shared for which purposes . More than being  a simple use case of blockchain, government -attested decentralised identity will also serve 
42  GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13     STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use as enablers for new public services provision  like electronic voting  or access to public  infrastructure.   Asset registries   In many countries, the ownership license and registry processes are still paper -based  and  fragmented, making transactions costly, inefficient, time -consuming and prone to fraud.  By securing a unique and non -corruptible record of ownership status and transactions on  blockchain, a reliable record can be created, for a piece of land, a property, and any other  valuable documents such as contracts. This also decreases time and cost in the registration  process by reducing the number of intermediaries required. Several countries among the  TG have been exploring blockchain -based solutions for registering land titles and  validating property -related government transactions.   Voting   Current voting systems are onerous to run and maintain, owing  to high costs in ballot  printing and electronic voting machines. Increasing threats of cyberattacks and ballot  rigging also compromise the election results. Blockchain has the potential to enabl e new  methods of voting that will combine decentralised digital identity management, anonymous  vote-casting, individualised ballot processes and verifiable ballot casting confirmation  (Deloitte, 2017a). Some c ountries have experimented with blockchain -enab led voting in a  bid to reduce costs, improve efficiency and allow greater participation in elections,  including remotely. Nonetheless, t ruly transformative services which enable decentralised  voting or civic governance without direct involvement of governm ents are missing from  the current landscape  (Allessie et al., 2019).   Customs clearance   Customs in cross -border logistics span a range of government and business operations and  involve multiple transactions. A prominent pain point has been the absence of effective  traceability, transparency and predictability of shipments coming in through the nation’s  ports  (Deloitte, 2017a) . The process of customs clearance and payment is often time consuming  and still involves manual processing in many places. Using blo ckchain can  improve security, data transparency and consistency, and auditability of recordkeeping  throughout the supply chain. It would help custom agencies worldwide eliminate delays in  identifying and processing international shippers and improving insp ection target .   Examples of AI and blockchain  experiments in TG countries   Australia  is exploring innovative ways to securely and efficiently deliver government  services using modern technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence and data  analytic s. For instance, The Digital Transformation Agency has released a set of guides  and tools to assist government agencies investigate potential blockchain applications. The  Australian Stock Exchange is using distributed ledger technology to upgrade its elect ronic  shares sub -register, clearing and settlements system. Data61 has entered into a consortium  with IBM and Herbert Smith Freehills to develop a national blockchain for smart legal  contracts.   Argentina  are rolling out pilots to automate assisted service delivery to citizens and to  recogni se patterns of claims. A fully functioning AI system has been deployed within  justice and public administration to drastically reduce time in processing judicial files and  human errors  (Box 3.2). Another  pilot project is being deployed to train AI system to obtain

The project developed jointly by the Government  Secretariat of Science and Technology and the private sector seeks to combine techniques  of natural language processing and m achine learning to reveal key information to solve  problems and make business decisions with greater information. As a pilot test, it consists  of training the selected technology in the interpretation of questions so that it is able to  understand the langu age of this specific topic and can give correct answers using  information from different sources ( e.g. scientific papers, journalistic articles, business ).  Box 3.2. Prometea – A fully functioning AI system withi n Argentine Justice and Public  Administration   Prometea is a system applied in the Public Ministry of the City of Buenos Aires to help  solving cases on behalf the Court of the City of Buenos Aires. It is also applied to public  contracts. The system combines  innovation layers: natural language processing, automation  and prediction. Prediction success rate is 96% in cases related to the right to housing, people  with disabilities, and labour law issues (67% of the cases we work with). Prometea  simplifies the da ta and information flow and exponentially accelerates the production of  needed documents. For instance, Prometea can help solving 1000 judicial files in 7 days  rather than in the 83 needed without it. In addition to time optimisation, Prometea reduces  typing and writing errors by 99%. Up to now, 161 cases have been resolved by using this  system (97 of them with prediction). Within other functionalities, the system has the power  to reduce to 2 minutes what is done manually in 3 days. In some cases, efficienc y is  optimized by 143,900% (2 days vs. 2 minutes).    In the Constitutional Court of Colombia, which received thousands of files daily, the time  destined to select urgent cases was reduced from 96 days to up to 2 hours since the  application of the machine le arning technique system. Prometea reads, analyses, detects  and in a few seconds suggests which are the priority cases within health related matters.  All this, under human supervision. Moreover, the tool is designed to automatically create  multiple document s. Thus, 14 documents can currently be created in 16 minutes, when  before it would take a person 2 hours and 40 minutes of work. The efficiency in this case  is increased by a 937%.   Prometea is also designed to be applied for example in the Inter -American C ourt of Human  Rights and the Argentine Association of Women Judges. The system has also been  presented in other institutions, international organisations and universities, including:  French Council of State, United Nations, Supreme Court of Justice of Arge ntina, Supreme  Court of Justice of Costa Rica, Public Prosecutors Office of the City of Sao Pablo,  Administrative Court of Lombardy, and University of París 1 (Panthéon -Sorbonne),  Oxford University, Alma Mater Studiorum Universita di Bologna and Universita  degli  Studi di Milano.

The use of open data  as a strategic tool for the enhanced use of AI  in the public  sector   Examples from Mexico (datos.gob.mx, Datalab and URBEM)   The availability and use of quality data are considered as being vital for the most efficient  use of AI programmes and research related to emerging technologies. Mexico has made  AI-related open data an  essential element of its National Digital Strategy and is promoting  its use for AI -related projects.   Open data access and sharing are promoted via the datos.gob.mx  platform. This platform  aims to “create a collabor ative ecosystem of public services, encouraging innovation and  entrepreneurship by turning information traditionally held by the government into an asset  of social value.”   “DATALAB” is an initiative of the Coordination of the National Digital Strategy of t he  Office of the President of Mexico designed to promote the use of data science, AI -related  technologies, and Open Data to stimulate the design and implementation of evidence -based  public policies by creating capacities within and outside of the Mexican F ederal  Government.    Several AI initiatives are being deployed in Mexico to enhance public services and  citizens’ life at both the national and local level. URBEM is a tool launched by the state of  Nuevo León’s Undersecretary of Legal Affairs and Citizen S ervices to provide inhabitants  of the region an AI -enabled chatbot in Facebook Messenger to accurately answer their  administrative requests, give access to useful documents while enabling feedback  gathering. Through these functions, URBEM can centralise da ta more efficiently and offers  an internal administrative dashboard to be used for internal management.     Italy  has launched a series of  Pre-Commercial  Procurement (PCP) initiatives at national  level to support the implementation of AI solutions to improve  public service  delivery’s  efficie ncy and effective ness. It is also leveraging on blockchain’s power to digitalise the   recognition process of academ ic qualifications (Box 3.4).   Box 3.4. CIMEA in Italy - blockchain technology applied to the field of recognition of  academic qualifications   CIMEA (Information Centre on Academic Mobility and Equivalence) is the official Italian  Centre within the NARIC (National Academic Recognition Information Centres) –  netwo rk of the European Union, and within the ENIC (European National Information  Centres) – network of the European Council and of UNESCO. Since 1984  CIMEA11  performs its activity of information provider and advisory body on the procedures of  qualifications’ re cognition and on themes linked to Italian and international higher  education and training.

46  GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13     STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use qualifications, with a vi ew to make qualifications increasingly more comprehensible and  recognisable in a national and international context.   CIMEA has decided to utilise the power of blockchain technology to digitalise the process  of certification of qualification (based on Lisbon Recognition Convention principals) and  for the CIS to eliminate any possibility of falsification of given certificates and qualification  information. The chosen approach is to create an ecosystem built on an interlaced  distributed network of informa tion that allows to precisely identify the credentials and  certification of any registered user and provides CIS services, certifying their truthfulness.  A modern distributed technology and strategic process flow approach takes success stories  from other m arkets and adapts them to the certification ecosystem utilising the latest  technologies as AI and blockchain, such as Diplome.   The Diplome ecosystem running on a permissioned blockchain network where every  stakeholder participates to building -up the ecosys tem based on its role: end user, certifying  authority, certifi ers. Certification Authorities are further divided in ‘Direct Certification  Authorities’ that are entitled only to issue certifications for users belonging to their  organization (e.g. Universiti es) and ‘Cross Certification Authorities’ that are entitled to  issue certifications on every user within the Diplome network (e.g. NARICS). Certification  issuers are handled by a blockchain oracle that acts as source of truth for authorized  certifiers . Eac h of the stakeholders has specific permissions on the network based on its  related entitlement. In case an organization   wants to participate to Diplome, an easy setup  based on free and open source software allows integration in no time.   Users, when parti cipating to Diplome, are assigned a personal meta -wallet within the  blockchain that will be their secure repository for every document related to their education.  This account belongs to the user and any interaction can only be authorised by the user  itself utilizing the cryptographic key assigned at time of the account’s creation. The account  is fed by external smart contracts handling different tasks. Whenever the user itself, his  organization or a cross certification authority adds a document related to the user education,  a dedicated smart contract is activated. The task of this smart contract is to verify that the  appropriate permissions (e.g. organization, user information) and data structure (e.g.  appropriate organization characteristics) are used tog ether with consistent metadata (e.g.  this certification is not in conflict with other certifications).  Diplome is in production since  early 2019 and already thousands of users have setup their Diplome wallets securely  loading and storing their certificates  within it.

Suspicious cases w ill be reported to dermatologists in Hospital Dermatology Departments  where an AI powered Risk Prioritization and Decision Support platform will help priorit ise  cases for further specialized analysis.   Along with that, Portugal is  implementing  a project th at aims to help minimize response  time of emergency medical services. Predictive models will be developed to help anticipate  service demand by combining existing historical data and context sensitive data from  several sources (e.g. weather). In addition, a project is running for the identification and  forecasting of the demand for hospital emergency rooms. The main goal is to identify, in a  timely manner, significant changes in patient -admissions to emergency care units. Medical  and non -medical related data sets will be used to produce a Probability Indicator for each  individual hospital emergency admission unit, thus effectively reducing waiting times,  optimizing resources, and reducing costs.

GOVTECH – blockchain technology in voting process   GovTech was a public competition that took place in Portugal in 2018, with the goal of  rewarding innovative products and services of start -ups that addressed at least one of the  17 Sustainable Development Goals. To participate in the competition, start -ups had to  submit functional prototypes of products or services, based on feasible business cases. The  public voted to choose six finalists, through an innovative voting process using blockchain  technology. From those six finalists, a jury of experts selected  the three winning projects.   The initiative was coordinated by the Administrative Modernization Agency (AMA),  which is the public sector organisation responsible for the promotion of administrative  modernization, under the Secretary of State Assistant for  Administrative Modernization  (SSAAM). The Camões Institute from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also played a central  role in coordinating the international cooperation and monitoring the 2030 Agenda in  Portugal.   The transparency and security of the voti ng process of this competition was based on an  Ethereum private experimental network, using blockchain technology, and a  cryptocurrency called GovTech was created to simulate the investment on the competing  projects. The process was very simple, after crea ting an account on the website, the citizens  automatically had a virtual wallet that they could manage, and were able to receive badges  for doing determined actions. Each badge had a certain amount of GovTechs associated.  For instance, when a citizen creat ed an account, he received a badge with 100 GovTechs.  If the login was made using the DMK (Digital Mobile Key), instead of the Citizens Card,  he received an extra badge of 200 GovTechs.   The project management was the responsibility of the Digital Transform ation Team in  AMA, but there was also a procurement process that resulted in the hiring of a private  company. Bright Pixel was the responsible for the development of the website of the  initiative and the voting process though a web platform and app based o n a blockchain  infrastructure, with the creation of the cryptocurrency and an exchange market.   This initiative provides a great example of using blockchain to bring trust and security to  the voting process, the experiment its application in the voting / i nvestment phase, which  worked as a learning experience for AMA. It was the first time a governmental initiative  used blockchain, so the goal was also to test the potential of this emerging technology and  produce some lessons to be used in future projects u sing this technology.   Regarding the Govtech competition in itself, in this first edition 113 prototypes were  approved and 1744 people/investors were registered on the initiative website. In the end,  there were three winning projects.

Big Data Analysis for HR efficiency improvement at Ministry of Public  Administration of Republic Slovenia   In Slovenia, the p ilot project “Big Data Analysis for HR efficiency improvement” was  established in 2017 as part of the development -oriented strategy supporting ICT as an  enabler for development of data -driven public administration. It ran within the Ministry of  Public Admi nistration of the Republic Slovenia (hereafter MPA) in collaboration with  EMC Dell as an external partner and the overall development time was 10 months.   This pilot project was launched to learn what big data tool installed on the Slovenian State  Cloud In frastructure could enable research of HR data of the ministry to improve its  efficiency. Therefore, anonymized internal data sources containing time management, HR  database, finance data and Public Procurement were combined with external resources  using po stal codes of employees and weather data to identify potentials for improvement  and possible patterns of behaviour.   The results showed that there is considerable potential for improvement in the field of HR  and lowering costs in the field of public procur ement within the MPA.   The pilot project confirmed that the use of big data tools could provide an effective and  solid basis for predicting process, planning policies and decision -making process on all  managerial levels in public administration based on exi sting internal data sources combined  with some external data. Gained experience also showed that big data analytics could help  improve the efficiency of MPA in decision -making by using different statistical and  quantitative analysis.

Another example is t he document "Blockchain - A flowchart can help" , which  with the  help of  a flowchart,  helps  to decide whether  blockchain  is an appropriate technology to use  in the given c ase. If appropriate, th e document will guide  the agency or institution to  define  functional aspects such as  the scope, relevance and characteristics of the implementation.   Box 3.8. Blockchain, beyond the hype: the experience of Uruguay   In the case of Uruguay, and after comparing different available options, Hyperledger Fabric  was chosen for experimentation. This is an open source tool with a simplified and more  flexible implementation of Smart Contracts and conf igurable consensus and membership  services.   A proof of concept on time -stamping for files was developed. Lessons learnt enabled  Agesic, the agency responsible for leading the national digital government policy , to  develop a guide by which institutions can assess the convenience of using blockchain and  which type of blockchain would be the most appropriate. This tool has already been used  for cases such as tracking supply chains with the foreign trade one -stop-shop.   Based on the experiences acquired, a strat egic plan is being prepared to harness the  opportunities provided by blockchain in the Government of Uruguay. The plan involves  development of blockchain based on shared assets to be incorporated into services by  public institutions and a platform for the deployment of BaaS (Blockchain as a Service)  solutions.   Uruguay developed an initiative called IA-CKATON , which objective  is to bring together  innovative ideas  use of AI to improve  State services. In addition to promoting  experimentation and development of the best projects in AI, they seek to encourage  entrepreneurship and collaborative work in an environment of healthy competition.   In the 2019  edition,  with the support of Red Gea lc, the activity will be a regional  competition involving Chile, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Dominican Republic and Uruguay.  Participating teams are requested to generate innovative pitches based on  the themes of the  different action areas of the 2020 Digital Government Plan .  IA-CKATON targets participants from academia, the public or private sector, or civil   society. Each participating country will carry out its own IA -CKATON instance and will  then choose a national winner; the winners of each country will participate in the regional  grand final and the finalist will present its work at the annual meeting of the Gealc Network  in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in October 2019.   In the previous edition ( 2018 ), 7 finalist teams participated in the IA -CKATON, which  proposed solutions to different social, educational and occupational issues. This year's  objective is to broaden the ecosystem by also inviting students from technological  universities to think and de sign proposals that contribute  to the improvement of public  digital services .  Agesic and other public agencies  are developing an "open" environment for accelerating  and testing data science and machine learning (CD/AA) solutions . The objective is to  provide access to state -of-the-art experts, infrastructure and software through open

Box 3.9. How the Department for Transport used AI to improve MOT testing   The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) in the UK wanted to use a more  intelligent, data -driven approach to better target their resources and ensure high MOT  standards. MOT tests check that cars meet the minimum road safety and environmental  standards required by law. Each year, 66,000 testers conduct 40 million MOT tests in  23,000 garages across Great Britain. A team of 300 DVSA a uditors are responsible for  ensuring garages are applying the MOT standards. This process is resource intensive and  does not allow for targeted inspections.   The DVSA applied a clustering model against garage test data from the last 3 months. This  grouped M OT centres based on the behaviour they show when conducting MOT tests,  creating a risk score for each garage. The algorithm combined the risk score with historical  data on correct application of MOT standards, allowing the DVSA to rank garages and their  testers, and helped the DVSA identify regional trends. The DVSA refreshed test data every  3 months giving auditors a 3 month windows to visit garages.   The DVSA can now target their resources at the garages and testers with the highest risk  score. By identify ing areas of concern in advance, the examiners’ preparation time for  enforcement visits has fallen by 50%. There has also been an increase in disciplinary action  against garages, meaning standards are now being better enforced. As more garages are  deliveri ng better MOT standards, there are more cars on the road that comply with  roadworthiness and environmental requirements .  AI is widely used across both central and local government in the UK. For example, the  Department for International Development is usi ng AI and satellite technology to provide  better population estimates. This improves the planning and delivery of aid operations and  vaccination projects. The UK’s ‘smart motorways’ use neural networks to anticipate and  manage traffic flow based on data on  road conditions from embedded sensors. AI is being  deployed to improve diagnosis of diverse health conditions, such as age -related macular  degeneration, lung cancer and heart disease, as illustrated under the AI and Data Grand  Challenge   Early Diagnosis Mi ssion. Machine learning  deployed by HM Revenue and Customs is   being used to detect potentially fraudulent  activity relating to tax. GOV.UK, the   government’s main platform, uses  supervised machine learning to help  organise content so  that it is readable to  technologies of the future. It’s possible to  see or hear our progress in  this area now: if  you ask the voice assistant technology  Google Assistant how to renew a  passport,  you’ll be informed by GOV.UK content.   Moreover, in 2018, the Government Digital  Service and the Office for Artificial   Intelligence (OAI) worked together to deliver  the Artificial Intelligence for Government   Review. The Review identified potential use  cases for AI across government and  explored  the barriers that exist to more  widespread us e.

Use of machine learning for sustainable data exchange   In Slovenia, a central system for data exchange exists as a powerful, flexible and reliable  technical solution, providing a solid basis for in terconnection of base registers and for  practical implementation of once -only principle.   The common data exchange system was originally developed in 2012 for e -social security  and is now being used by many public sector institutions as a tool for efficient  and safe data  gathering and data sharing. For example, all public procurement procedures are using it, e government portal, anti -money laundering and anti -corruption service... Central population  register also distributes its data using these mechanisms. Over 10 M transactions were  processed last year (in a country with 2 M population). Ministry of Public Administration  is responsible for developing and maintaining the solution and providing the service.  Various measures and levers are used to ensure high uptake of the system.   Extensive use also causes risks for reliable and stable performance, because the workload  (number of enquiries in a given time frame) is not constant, and the channel capabilities are  always limited. The system must be able to effici ently handle unpredictable temporary  peaks. On one side, the clients requesting data must enjoy agreed and expected response  times and on the other side, the datasources must be protected from too heavy burden  threatening to flood their limited server capa bilities.   A new feature was developed in 2018, which utilizes machine learning techniques to  optimize the data flow. It captures all the incoming traffic in a kind of a pool and then  controls the forwarding intensity by knowing the past and current perform ances of the  connected systems. It is constantly monitoring the performance of integrated systems in  real time, incrementally learning from its "real time big data" flow and using the knowledge  to optimize the intensity of calls. The machine learning syste m uses traditional approaches  and is implemented under the IBM CRISP -DM Machine Learning Scheme. Incremental  learning is carried out using the algorithms of the Java Machine Learning Framework -  WEKA and MOA (Massive On -Line Analysis), allowing predictive modelling by flow data  mining.   This new learning and throttling system allows to monitor and improving the utilization of  datasources. This ensures maximum throughput of the system, its stable performance and  the timely acquisition of data.   The results of predicting the datasource performance are higher average speed of data  inquiries and minimum queueing. High stability, robustness and technical sustainability of  the entire system is consequently ensured.

Discussion  and preliminary lessons learnt    Emergi ng and disruptive technologies are often over -hyped at early stages of inception .  Governments often feel forced to show enthusiasm and demonstrate that they are adopting  the technology, turning it at times into a flagship initiative  but without having comp leted a  sound analysis and formulated a real value proposition to argument and justify the adoption .  This has been the case of AI and blockchain in recent  years. Yet, as many other  technological breakthroughs, these emerging technologies  are still in a con stant state of  flux, and governments are just starting to discover how they work and how they can be  applied to resolve specific problems . Rather than (over) promoting the technology, it is  important t o focus on the real needs and complete a sound analysis on the potential benefits  in responding to those needs, and on the related implications (i.e. from a political, legal,  security perspective). Pros and cons associated with the use of any emerging tech nology  should be addressed methodically and with an understanding of real potential s and  implications, including the challenges and the opportunities , which are specific to the  public sector .  Based on findings from the 2 0 TG countries, t his section  discuss es the major obstacles to   the adoption and application of emerging digital technologies  in the public sector. It will  then offer  a set of preliminary lessons learnt and further research questions to help  governments better navigate their digital transforma tion agenda .   4.1. Major barriers to  public sector adoption of emerging digital technologies   Participants of the TG  have  identified  three types  of barriers  to the adoption  of emerging  digital technologies across public sector organisations  (Figure 4.1) . These include:    Technical and practical challenges , such as the availability of quality data , lack  of common standards  and the level of interoperability between different IT  systems;     Resource and capacity constraints , for instance, the lack of specific skills in  public administration, low digital literacy in society and inadequate level of  investments and funding for R&D or early experiments;    Institutional, legal and cultural barrier s, particularly unsuitable legal  and  regulatory  framework , resistance to change and insufficient political commitment   in part due to risk aversion .   Among these, the absence of common standards and suitable legislation are the most quoted  obstacle s, followed by skills shortages in the publi c sector , , lack of institutional buy -in and  inadequate investment and funding . More than two fifths of the surveyed participants   identified with challenges that are  institutional, legal or cultural in nature,  while just  beneath a third  mentioned  technical  and practical  constraints. The key challenge s for public  sector organisations today consist of  understanding what they can do with emerging  technologies  and how to apply them to optimise specific services.   More broadly, a  major constraint identified  in the use of emerging digital technologies by  public sector organisations  is the lack of governance in this specific field. Still faced with  institutional setup that are a legacy from the past, where choices around the adoption and  deployment of technolog y are sector based in vertically integrated administrations, v arious 
54  GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13     STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use participants  of the TG are currently experimenting governance models t hat shall  assist the  public sector in the introduction of ET in line with the overall governance needs of a digital  government . The aim is to facilitate the emergence of a whole -of-government and coherent  approach to the use of technology  to simplif y public services and thus overcome existing  difficulties , such as lack of relevant experti se inside the  public administrati on, as underlined  by the OECD Recommendation on Digital Government Strategies (2014).    Figure 4.1. Major barriers to adoption of emerging technologies in public sector     Source : Author’s elaboration based on responses from Thematic Group (TG) countries   Technical  and practical challenges   There are many  technical barrier s that governments need to overcome, for instance, more  investment is needed to upgrade legacy IT systems to reduce risk of incompatibility in t he  integration of future software . There is also a considerable lack of standards. For instance,  data availability and interoperability  are often limited across public sectors as stove piped organisations manage data within silos, and as a result, it turns  out quite difficult to  identify or access multiple data sources.   Furthermore , the quality of data  is a crucial precondition  for all AI and blockchain  projects , sometimes even more important than the quantity of data. It has been observed  that the importan ce of quality data (or the lack thereof) is often raised as the most important  aspect that contributes to success or failure in an AI initiative. Some have even gone as far  as to say that most governments simply are not ready for AI, and that they first sh ould focus  on getting their data in order (OECD, AI primer , forthcoming). In this regard, the OECD  AI Recommendation places a focus on putting in place a digital ecosystem for AI, including  infrastructure and mechanisms for sharing AI knowledge (including data). Similarly, the  quality of data input at the origin will directly affect qualify of the data on a blockchain and  hence the quality of any analytical results derived from that data . (Welby, van Ooijen  and  Ubaldi, 2019 [20])   
GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13   55    STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use  It is also important to note that  a large part of most blockchain applications in governments   or enterprises today is about integrating the distributed ledger with disparate  and legacy  centralised  systems  that continue to store off-chain  data for reasons of  scalability (big data)   or confidentiality (private data). It is important to bear in mind that blockchain is usually  just one layer of a broader , often sophisticated  IT system, and that many classic sof tware  engineering problems will still need to be dealt with  in the process of design and  implementation  (Staples et al., 2017) .  Resource and capacity challenges   Public sector staff and management are considered to be one of the most important drivers  of pu blic sector innovation.  However, initiatives to develop, motivate and deploy internal  talents  today  are largely inadequate. The level of digital capabilities  and awareness of the  impact of technology is generally lower in public sector. With an aging Baby Boomer  workforce, s ome countries  are facing particularly acute  personnel challenges  in the public  sector , whilst an important share of the workforce continues to be  overburdened with  mundane, repetitive tasks . Automation could potentially ease some of thes e resource  constraints, and younger, tech -savvy workers, such as data scientists and subject matter  experts, would need to  be hired to bolster competencies in the public sector .  Besides limited knowledge on latest technological advancements , managing  digital  transformation projects is fraught with risk and complexity, which requires specific skills   (such as data analytics, user experience and interface, etc.) that are often in short supply in  public administrations. Moreover, some TG participants ment ioned that there is still a  shortage of adequate  funding . For instance, Necessary computing resources should be  ensured for an AI project. While cloud computing solutions may suffice for certain AI  applications, more heavy data crunching might require more  expensive graphical  processing units.   Institutional, legal and cultural challenges   The progress of digital transformation of the public sector typically encounters hurdles  at  the institutional  / organisational,  legal  and cultural levels. The following wil l address three  specific challenges : risk aversion, resistance to change, and regulatory hurdles .  Risk aversion   An important factor  for governments to consider is understanding the right time to take a  risk with an ET for experimentation and when to consider something sufficiently well  understood and mature for it to become “mainstream ” and applied more broadly across  different government services.  The fear of making mistakes , linked to experimentation  and  testing, is deep rooted in the public sector and can sometimes act as a barrier to innovation  and calculated risk -taking , resulting in inaction or insufficient leadership  commitment (OECD, 2017b).  Wardley Maps12 provide a valuable technique for gauging   the maturity of di fferent technologies and understanding where governments could best  focus their energies to maximise value to their stakeholders (Wardley, 2018 [21]).                                                          12 A Wardle y map is a map of the structure of a business or service, mapping the components needed  to serve the customer or user. It is named after Simon Wardley who claims to have created it in  2005.  
56  GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13     STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use Resistance to change   The ability to drive change and align people around a shared vision is crucial for advancing  digital transformation of the public sector. Resistance to change appears particularly strong  in some applications of blockchain, as its implications on decentrali sation are incompatible  with today’s institutional structures of governments  (Allessie et al., 2019) .  Resistance to change stems from a variety of factors, including : fear of failure or being  replaced  by automation and disintermediation technologies ; fear of radical transparency   brought by technologies like blockchain, whose traceability can fully expose errors and  incompetence; lack of innovation mindset  resulting in absence of change leadership and  biased perception of innovation possibilities; inadequate  incentive structure  penalising or  failing to recognise initiative -taking; and rigid institutional setups , organisational rules  or  bureaucracy discouraging experiments of new approaches  or different governmental  sections to work together .   In recent years, the fear of being replaced has gathered much public attention. There is  growing recognition that technologies like AI and blockchain will change the nature of  work as they replace and/or augment components of human labour, while simultaneo usly  creating new tasks for humans. Properly handling the potential negative employment  implications of automation technologies can sometimes make or break  the progress of  digital government transformation. Needles s to mention, c ontinuous education, traini ng  and skills development programmes should be provided to secure institutional buy -in and  facilitate short and long -term transitions  as people move from one job to another.   Regulatory  Challenges   Digitalisation challenges the rationale for traditional appr oaches to the design, enforcement  and governance of regulation. As both an enabler and a user of emerging digital  technologies, governments are facing the headache of how to regulate them to maximise  their innovative potential while minimising the risks  for end users  (OECD, 2019d) .   There are growing concerns and increased awareness around the challenges AI is creating  in terms of privacy, security , fairness,  and ethical issues . Given their reliance on  historical  and societal  data, the use of algorithms can propagate existing biases or make  them self -fulfilling in controversial policy areas, such as in recruitment, crim inal justice  or  recidivism prediction, where gender bias , racial discriminations or other stereotyped  associa tions might recur (Cairns, 2019 [22]). With AI -enabled services often targeting the  most vulnerable members of society who may be least able to navigate or deal with the  complexities of new technologies , and in line with the OECD AI Recommendation, those  responsible for designing  and operating  these services should  ensure their transparen cy,  fairness, robustness and accountability  (OECD, 2019c) . There would be additional  challenges on how to regulate and  enforce the accountability of AI systems.   Privacy and confidentiality  are also a challenge for certain types of blockchain  applications. Generally, a necessary trade -off will have to be struck between  decentralisation and privacy settings. Permissionless chains offer radical transparency and  greater independence from centralise d authorities than permissioned chains, but could  entail risks to the exploitation of personal data (Berryhill et al., 2018). The solution has  usually been storing identity information off -chain to preserve its confidentiality, although  this comes at the e xpense of transparency and independent auditability and partly  undermines the distinctive benefit of blockchains in providing distributed trust. This may 
GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13   57    STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use  also create a single point of failure and reduce other benefits of a distributed network, such  as syst em availability and reliability.   Furthermore, t raditional notion of liability  is challenged in the case of smart contracts . In  fact, incompatibility between blockchain -based solutions and existing legal framework is  a major barrier to unlock the transformative potential of blockchain (Allessie et al., 2019).   For instance, the legality of digital signatures and notarisation vi a cryptographic proofs is  currently unresolved. It is also difficult to scale cross -border adoption if legal  harmonisation is required. Lack of regulation and governance standards therefore hinders  the development of more disruptive blockchain services bey ond a proof -of-concept or early  pilot phase. Moreover, w hen a breach of smart contract occurs, it may be caused by either  of the contracting parties, or inherent flaws within the contract itself, due to coding or  design errors.  In the latter case, current laws and regulations have difficulties in  apportioning and attributing responsibility for damage caused by technology to end users.    4.2. Preliminary discussion of key enabling  factors    Governments  and public sector organisations  can leverage digital tech nologies to better  inform and steer decisions for the benefits of businesses, citizens and societies. These  developments can foster significant advances towards a more anticipatory, evolutionary  and collaborative public governance that is capable to delive r responses to changing needs  with greater agility. However, a paradigm shift is essential to adopt transformative  approaches to public service delivery and value creation, which can still guarantee  equitable share of benefits across societies  (OECD, Forthcoming [23]). Participants of the  TG have identified four sets of enabling factors for facilitating  public sector adoption of  emerging technologies (Figure 4.2). These include:    Public sector commitment , most importantly political support, followed by  cultural commitment (to innovation and reforms), civil servant creativity and sound  legal framework;    Partner engagement , from the private sector as technology provider or co developer and from various ecosystem of stakeholder s13;   Technological maturity , typically a dynamic academic environment that spurs  creativity, presence of innovation clusters and advanced research establishments;    Education and s ocietal readiness , as measured by the level of digital literary of  the populati on, public servant's expertise and buy -in of emerging technologies, and  degree of digitalisation in different sectors of the societ y.  Among these, political support is the most quoted enabling condition , followed by the  commitment of private sector actors.  Above  two fifths of supportive factors relate to public  sector commitment. It is also worth mentioning that political support and stakeholder   engagement, or the lack thereof, have been mentioned  both as an enabler and  a barrier to  public sector adoption  of emerging technologies . The following section will focus on  discussing two  types  of enabling factors: public sector commitment and partner  engagement.                                                          13 Countries underlined the importance of involving both public and  private sector actors, from academia, non profit, industry, and different levels of government.

The OECD  identified five key priorities to create enabling environments for trustworthy AI  in the OECD AI Recommendation  (May 2019). National policies are needed to promote  trustworthy AI systems and spur beneficial and fair outcomes for people and for the planet,  especially in promising areas underserved by market -driven investments. The creation of  an enabling policy envi ronment for trustworthy AI includes, among other things,  facilitating public and private investment in AI research and development and equipping  people with the skills necessary to succeed as work evolves  (Box 1) .   Public sector commitment   The implementati on of emerging technologies  would need  new mindsets , leadership and  skills  in the public sector to secure  commitment to  sustainable  and inclusive digital  transformation . To this end, three specific factors appear most essential : cultural  commitment to chan ge, political support, and solid legal and regulatory framework to  address uncertainties and policy gaps.   
GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13   59    STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use  Cultural commitment   Today, digital transformation involving emerging technologies such as AI and blockchain  is likely to implicate many processes and systems and affect the functions, expectations  upon and role of government in societies that are constantly evolving. Many governments  are shifting focus to a more strategic and systematic  approach to digital. They are stepping  up understanding  of the pote ntial value of using emerging technologies  to fulfil their  mandate and public expectations and keep ing abreast with the scale, complexity and speed  of digital  transformation occurring across all segments of the economy. Acquiring  adequate knowledge  and skills will be one of the core actions  in creating  a pool of  dedicated civil servants  and experts , capable of  identif ying appropriate technologies for  rethinking and innovating a given task, purpose or need .  Incentive change  will play a fundamental role in  nurturing cultural commitment to  continuous improvements and “outside of the box” thinking in the public sector . There  needs to be a cultural shift at all levels of governments in being comfortable with  (reasonable  level of ) uncertainty  arising from the u se of emerging technologies and  recognising the value of trial -and-error. This will require efforts on two fronts: first, a  new  system of adequate incentives to encourage public administration leaders and staff to  engage in learning -by-doing , for which fai lures are valued as much as success es. This  implies that human resources departments will need to be more strategic and integrate  experiments and initiative -taking in staff performance evaluation and promotion. Second,  experiments should follow a set of pr e-established, well -thought methods or principles, and  a fine balance needs to be sought between risk -taking and early -stage innovation on the one  hand, and stability, predictability and value -for-money on the other.   Political support   The recognition from the p olitical leadership of ETs being an important asset to support the  digitalization of the public sector  is essential . A pro -active engagement of governments,  parliaments and top -officials within the public sector  towards ET adoption is fundamental  to also set long -term strategies that define  the vision and identify the infrastructure and  assets needed to support innovation in public services  enabled by ET . Political support is  also necessary to enforce long -term actions to foster educ ation and research in ET as well  to create a prolific ecosystem for start -ups and private sector to offer adequate ET -based  services and solutions to the public sector    As previously highlighted, pragmatic and calculated risk -taking  can help gain political   support when  governments  and public sector organisations experiment with emerging  technologies . This is best illustrated  in the procurement of digital technologies : large -scale  high-risk projects  can be separated  from smaller ones that can go to younger p layers to  encourage broader -based innovation and diversify the pool of solution providers ; while  less  risk adverse areas can be differentiated from others where the best decision for a public  agency is to be a market follower to ensure value for money.  In addition, more freedom can  be given to experimenting with new ideas and practices at the local level first before  upgrading to the national level in case of successful outcomes.   As emerging technologies are likely to redefine, partially if not integrally,  the  organisation’s main goals, roles and functions, political  support for public sector adoption  of new technologies  will need to be translated into  new working methods , practices  and  structures . Flexibility in certain administrative procedures and rules can be considered to   allow  quicker feedback and more agile design thinking approaches, and a pilot can start  small and focused in order to control political risk exposure and reduce administrative cost

As data is the fuel of digital tra nsformation  and the infrastructure needed  for a fruitful use of AI  and blockchain, an adequate data governance , which facilitates  data availability, interoperability, quality, accessibility and sharing, will be a critical factor  for reaping full benefits  of the technologies (OECD, 2018 [24]).   For example in 2017, the Australian Productivity Commission’s Data Availability and Use  Inquiry found significant barriers to effective data sharing by Australian Government  agencies. In 2018 and in response to the Inquiry, the Australian Government announ ced a  $65 million investment for a suite of reforms to improve the way data is accessed, shared  and released, and improve safeguards for data. This suite of reforms includes:   • introducing a Consumer Data Right to give Australians greater access and contr ol  over their data, empowering them to be able to get a better deal from their bank, energy  and telecommunications companies;   • establishing a National Data Commissioner to improve how the Australian  Government manages and uses data;   • establishing a Natio nal Data Advisory Council to advise the National Data  Commissioner on ethical data use and technical issues;   • introducing Data Sharing and Release legislation to improve the use and reuse of  public sector data, while strengthening the security and privacy  protections for personal  and sensitive data; and continuing to engage widely with the community on the data  governance and stewardship issues.   Similarly, the UK is developing its National Data Strategy, which it expects to publish in  2020. In 2018, the UK  created the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, housed under  DCMS. This is an independent body advising the UK Government on the benefits & risks  of AI and data -driven technology. Its brief covers (1) analysing and anticipating risks and  opportunities such as gaps in governance and regulation that could impede the ethical and  innovative deployment of data and AI; (2) agreeing and articulating best practice such as  codes of conduct and standards that can guide ethical and innovative uses of AI; and (3)   advising government on the need for action including specific policy or regulatory actions  required to address or prevent barriers to innovative and ethical uses of data. GDS and the  Office for AI worked with the Alan Turing Institute - the UK's national in stitute for data  science and artificial intelligence - to develop new guidance, Understanding Artificial  Intelligence Ethics and Safety   Governments should consider the need for a rounded 360° data vision, a holistic view to  guarantee public agencies the us e of data in the context of AI and Blockchain.  Not only  working on a Data Strategy for adopting a data -driven government but also in establishing  principles that settles the fundamental basses. A whole -of-government approach for the  develop ment  of this da ta strategy, establishing a common view on data collection,  management, governance, and use, with the aim of improving service delivery, better  informing decision -making, enhancing operations, and fostering trust through privacy,  transparency and accountab ility.  Data is the central asset in everything that government oversees and provides. The ability  to leverage that data strategically, in real time, will drive data -based decision making and  will enable step -level change in government’s ability to seamless ly deliver services.   Furthermore, governments should consider the governance and organisational impacts of  blockchain implementations, given their fundamental differences with traditional  centralised information infrastructures (Allessie et al., 2019). To  fully harness the potential 
GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13   61    STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use  of blockchain in the public sector, administrative processes and governmental  structures may need to be  re-engineered  to adapt to the technology and not the other way  around  (Allessie et al., 2019) .  Sound regulatory  framework   Regulation offers important opportunities for governments to capitalise on the benefits  while mitigating the risks brought by digitalisation . Governments are using legal and  regulatory instruments to provide guidance to facilitate the use of emerging techno logies  in different departments14, or to support their use in specific policy areas15.   It is however important to emphasise the regulation of process and outcome  over  regulation of system. Regulations that are technologically deterministic might get stuck  rather than be able to flex with the fast pace of technological changes we currently see.  Building on previous discussions undertaken within the OECD Regulatory Policy  Committee, a new set of guidance will soon be proposed to support governments in  choosing  among the range of regulatory and alternative approaches to promote digital  innovation and reduce risks (OECD, 2019d).   Partner engagement – maximise synergies through public -private collaboration   Governments and public sector organisations should partner  with the private sector to  leverage industry progress in advanced digital technologies and support open innovation.  Countries  like Chile , Panama  and Latvia  have been promoting  public -private collaboration  through a series  of Memorandums of Understanding (MoU), to implement pilot  experiences in the application of Big Data, Cloud Computing and AI.  Estonia has aimed to  offer new ways to co-operat e with the private sector, such as by organi sing deep -dive  events16 or by offering  “sandbox” environment for technology companies to work on  existing applications and solutions.  Italy launched a dedicated platform for innovative  procurement, supporting the development of new solutions able to satisfy the «smart  needs», identified by the  Italian Digital Strategy . The new approach is expected to generate  a positive impact on the public sector as system  and bring the development of technological  solutions that can be replicated in other public and private contexts, with additional   economic  repercussions that can contribute to accelerating entrepreneurial growth  in the  Country . Korea is shifting from essentially focusing on financial provision  for  technolog ical developmen ts, to providing support in a more  comprehensive way, through  which it c an bolster technology, data, infrastructure, expansion and legal improvement s  altogether. The Korean government  is also working to establish an ecosystem where the  public sector supports private market formulation, with the aim of maximising the latter’s  innovation capacity.                                                          14 For instance, in Canada, the Treasury Board Policy Suite is using a series of quasi -legal, often binding policy  instruments that provide best practice direct ion to departments. Finland prepared a study of algorithms as  decision -makers and the possibilities and challenges of artificial intelligence in the Finnish national regulatory  environment.   15 In Finland, the Government resolutions on data and robotics were  given in late May and early June 2017 to  support development of intelligent transport services, information security, robotics and big data.   16 At the end of the year 2018, Estonia held its first e -Government hackathon in Tallinn together with Garage  48, a start -up hackathon series. It is planning to go on with hackathons also in 2019, expecting to have around  four hackathons per year.

Questions for further work and guidance   This working paper has tried to capture  the current state of  art on the public sector adoption   of emerging digital technologies , with a specific focus on AI  and blockchain. It raised the  attention on some of the  associated  challenges and opportunities currently facing   governments  and public sector organisations. The key assessments are derived from the  first round of data gathering and analysis conducted on the 2 0 TG countries since Januar y  2018. At the time of this writing, more initiatives than the ones presented in the paper are  being implemented or developed in several countries among the TG. Given that  governments are  still at an early stage of using some of these emerging technologies , a  permanent mapping exercise will be helpful to better evaluate the public sector adoption  trends, identify replicable good practices , create synergies and foster experience sharing  among a wider range of OECD member and partner countries.   Building on th e main findings of the work completed so far by the E -leaders’ TG, f urther  experiments and analysis are required to resolve some of the challenges encountered in the  use of emerging technologies in public sector , as highlighted in the relevant sections abo ve,  and be able to ground on experience concrete guidance. Practically speaking, the following  checklist could be used in the development of such guidance:   What actions are needed to strengthen the following enablers  for public sector adoption  of emerging  technologies ?  ● Securing p olitical support ;   ● Securing p rivate sector commitment ;  ● Promoting p ublic awareness ;  ● Fostering a dynamic academic environment ;  ● Creating synergies with i nnovation centres and labs ;  ● Nurturing and providing incentives for  creativity of the public servants , and  building up digital competencies in public administration as a key step towards  digital mature organisations ;  ● Supporting start -ups and private sector initiatives to bring value to the public  sector ;  ● Participati ng in the international debate .   What actions are needed to help address the following constraints ?   ● Lack  of common standards ;  ● Unsuitable legal framework ;  ● Lack of specific competences in the public sector ;  ● General low understanding of ET and low digital lite racy across the population ;  ● Limited u nderstanding of the role of the ecosystem including  actors outside the  government ;  ● Creation and fostering of synergies with the academia and the private sector ; 
GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13   63    STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use  ● Establishment of a flexible governance model able to  ensur e a whole -ofgovernment approach and the right level of control  over the  adoption of these  potentially transformative technologies  in the public sector.   ● The OECD is currently developing practical guidance on the AI Recommendation,  to guide governments in i ts implementation, including in those areas related to  adoption in the public sector.    More generally, f uture efforts and analysis could for example aim at assisting  governments’ efforts in line with the point below:   ● First of all , the efficiency of public  investments  should be continuously monitored  to provide more evidence -based indication on the effective level s and forms of  public support for technological development and adoption . This will also be useful  to enable governments in presenting sound business cases – or value propositions  – when  investing in ET.   ● Second,  there should be further assessment of the design and appropriate mix of  regulatory approaches  – including soft and hard regulatory instruments – on the  public sector adoption  of emerging digital technologies  and their associated social,  ethical and legal implications . For instance, m any governments are taking steps to  revisit their regulatory frameworks to address key concerns of fairness,  transparency, privacy and accountability  arising f rom the use of AI . So far,  the  main focus has been on regulati on in the digital economy ; in the future, m ore  attention should be given to regulation of its use within governments and public  sector organisations , which may require a finer understanding of t he distinct  features, needs and challenges of public sector users.   ● Third , a comparison of different models of co-design and co -delivery  arrangements will help governments appraise  the advantages and limitations of  each approach and find the right  combinati on of public, private and social effort s  in the design and implementation of innovative services. In particular, a s  governments embrace emerging technologies , where does it start in order to make  sure they are capably equipped  to be both a sophisticated co nsumer and user, and  an effective regulator and overseer?  While governments will need to establish good  working relationships with the private sector, how does that work in practice?  Where to draw the balance between increasing internal absorptive capacity , i.e.  public sector ability to understand and capture opportunities and steer changes, and  outsourcing substantial amounts of digital interventions to the private sector,  remains one of the most significant challenges in transitioning from e -government  to digital government practices. Part of the answers may come from how  governments are adapting governance mechanisms ( e.g. institutional setups) to  properly lead, coordinate, promote and monitor the adoption of emerging  technologies in the public sector.   ● Finally,  there needs to be a comprehensive analysis of the implications  and pros  and cons  of blockchain applications in the public sector, as well as their genuine  impact on improving  participatory and collaborative  democracy. T he role of State   and central ised institutions  in a hyper -digitised economy and society  will need  to be revisited, and new forms of democratic participation may emerge to address  the limitations of nation -states and today’s digital monopolies. To varying degrees,  blockchain -based dece ntralised governance poses  challenges to the traditional  constructs of State authority, citizenship and democracy  (Atzori, 2017) . While 
64  GOV/PGC/EGOV(2019)13     STATE OF THE ART IN THE USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR   For Official Use many enthusiasts simply promote blockchain as a more efficient and trustworthy  instrument to increase citizens’ ownershi p over democratic processes, techno libertarians openly encourage the use of blockchain to empower bottom -up, self governed community against the very concept of authority. Against the backdrop  of strong public dissent against institutions , there may be  merit in reducing  concentration or abuse of power with distributed technologies, but to what extent  it is possible to decentralise public administration through blockchain, which parts  of government services are possible and desirable to be managed through  permission less networks, and to what extent blockchains and decentralised  platforms can indeed manage political interactions on large scale (Atzori, 2017)?  All these questions warrant further carefully designed  experiments and open  consultations with citize ns and the civil society.

Background Information on the OECD Thematic Groups   Role, mandate and purpose of the OECD Thematic Groups   The Thematic Groups of the OECD Working Party of Senior Digital Government Officials  (E-Leaders) of the Public Governance Committee adopt an empirical approach to look into  concrete cases of application and implementation (i.e. existing projects and experi ments  implemented or foreseen across OECD member countries) to identify key policy actions  for governments in priority areas selected by the delegates. This work responds to the  request of the adherent countries to the OECD Recommendation on Digital Govern ment  Strategies to complement the Recommendation with specific guidance in priority areas for  the member countries.   The Thematic Group on Emerging Technologies (AI & blockchain )   For few years the OECD Working Party of Senior Digital Government Officials (ELeaders) has been discussing the main opportunities and challenges associated with the  increasing uptake of emerging technologies across the public sector, as part of the broader  digital transformation efforts. The Thematic Group on Emerging Technologie s (focused  mainly on Artificial Intelligence and blockchain ) of the E -Leaders is a direct follow -up to  the 2017 meeting in Lisbon, where delegates recognised the need to better understand this  trend in order to be able to go beyond the hype and gauge the r eal value of emerging  technologies for the public sector. 20 countries are actively participating in the TG activities  and are collaborating with the Secretariat.   In line with the above, the Thematic Group on Emerging Technologies has the following  object ives:    Map the current use of emerging technologies in the public sector across OECD  member and partner countries;    Understand the implications, requirements and impacts of using emerging  technologies to foster the digital transformation of the public sect or and provide  innovative solutions for public services;    Analyse in particular the possible impact of ET use on citizens’ wellbeing and the  role of established ethical frameworks to improve citizens’ trust;    Exchange knowledge on existing practices, or on -going experiments, and related  challenges faced by governments in the use of emerging technologies in the public  sector worldwide to shed lights on “what works” and what “doesn’t”;    Develop a set of guidelines to assist governments in advancing a meaningf ul,  effective and sustainable use of emerging technologies across their public sectors.   As shown by the map below, the TG is composed of 18 OECD member countries, 2 non member countries and the European Commission.  Five countries contributed to the  mappi ng without being involved in the preliminary phase of the work of the TG. These  countries are: Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.

The potential of Artificial Intelligence for the public administrations is manifold.   The work of the TG is showing how the development of  AI technologies has already an  impact on the public sector and it is expected that the use of AI will play a growing role in  the development of public policies itself.

List of emerging technologies   Defining which technologies are tr uly “emerging” is difficult because so few of the usual  metrics – journal citations, number of researchers in a new field, budgets and products on  the market  – are readily available. Moreover, many emerging technologies are defined less  by the parameters o f a particular field (biology, physics, etc.) than by the global challenges  they seek to address (the search for new sources of clean energy, the effort to deal with  Alzheimer's disease and dementia in an ageing society, the provision of safe drinking wate r,  etc.) (OECD Policies for emerging technologies ).  By emerging technologies, the participants of the TG mean the ones that, even  if not  enlisted as frontier technologies, might be able to produce innovative solutions for public  services, as to reflect the objectives of the Thematic Group. We have provided to list the  ones that we were so far able to map and that we think are able t o provide innovation in the  delivery of public services.

The  structured data may be used simply to classify a document, as in “this report  describes a laparoscopic cholecystectomy,” or it may be used to identify findings,  procedures, medications, allergies and participants25;   Biome trics:  enable more natural interactions between humans and machines,  including but not limited to image and touch recognition, speech, and body  language26;   Computer vision : is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can  be made for gaining high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From  the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual  system can do ;   Machine Learning : the goal is to devise learning algorithms that do the learning  automatically with out human intervention or assistance27;                                                         22 ibid. 38   23 ibid. 38   24 https://narrativescience.com/Resources/Resource -Library/Article -Detail -Page/what -is-natural -language generation  (accessed on 21 February  2019)   25 ibid. 38   26https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2017/01/23/top -10-hot-artificial -intelligence -aitechnologies/#58eaa8b71928  (accessed on 21  February  2019)   27 https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr08/cos511/scribe_notes/0204.pdf  (accessed on  21 February  2019)
