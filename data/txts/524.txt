        Abstract
        
    








This paper discusses the promises and perils of AI in health, and the key policy questions that policy makers will need to address in an uncertain landscape. The goal is to foster a shared understanding and to inform a G20 dialogue on AI on the main policy issues of AI use in the health sector.
