1. Introduction
The Algorithmic Impact Assessment (AIA) is a mandatory risk assessment tool intended to support the Treasury Board’s Directive on Automated Decision-Making. The tool is a questionnaire that determines the impact level of an automated decision system. It is composed of 65 risk questions and 41 mitigation questions. Assessment scores are based on many factors, including the system’s design, algorithm, decision type, impact and data.
The AIA was developed based on best practices in consultation with both internal and external stakeholders. It was developed in the open and is available to the public for sharing and reuse under an open licence.

2. Using and scoring the assessment
This assessment is organized according to Government of Canada policy, ethical and administrative law considerations applied to the context of automated decision-making. It draws on the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat’s (TBS’s) consultations with public institutions, academia and civil society. The AIA is designed to help departments better understand and manage the risks associated with automated decision systems. The AIA is composed of questions to assess the areas of risk defined in Tables 1.1 to 1.6.

Tables 1.1 to 1.6: risk areas

2.1 Scoring 
Each area contains one or more questions, and the  responses to the questions contribute to a maximum  score for the area. The value of each question is weighted based on the level  of risk it introduces or mitigates in the automation project. The raw impact  score measures the risks of the automation, while the mitigation score measures  how the risks of automation are managed. The questions in risk areas 1 to 6  increase the raw impact score  (see Table 3), and the questions in mitigation areas 7 and 8  increase the mitigation score  (see Table 4).

The current score is determined as follows:

if the  mitigation score is less than 80% of the maximum attainable mitigation score,  the current score is equal to the raw impact score
if the  mitigation score is 80% or more than the maximum attainable mitigation score,  15% is deducted from the raw impact score to yield the current score



2.2 Impact levels 
The impacts of  automating an administrative decision are classified into four levels, ranging  from Level I (little impact) to Level IV (very high impact). The AIA  is intended to identify risks and assess impacts in a broad range of areas,  including:

the rights  of individuals or communities
the health  or well-being of individuals or communities
the  economic interests of individuals, entities or communities
the  ongoing sustainability of an ecosystem

Impact levels also  vary based on the duration and reversibility of the decision, the context in  which the system is operating, and the risk associated with the data used by  the system. 
  Each impact level  corresponds to a score percentage range. The level of impact assigned to an  automation project depends on the range bracket in which the project’s score  percentage falls (see Table 5). Impact levels determine the mitigations  required under the Directive on Automated  Decision-Making. Appendix C of the directive lists mitigation measures  required for each of the four impact levels. The requirements are designed to  be proportionate to the impact level. While the measures are intended to reduce  the identified risks, their implementation does not alter the impact level  assigned to a project. A project’s impact level can be changed only through the  completion of a new AIA with updated information about the project. Under the  directive (subsection 6.1.3), departments are required to review, approve  and update their published AIAs on a scheduled basis, including following  changes to system functionality or scope of use.

Table 5: Impact level definitions


Impact level
Definition
Score percentage range




Level I
Little to no impact
0% to 25%


Level II
Moderate impact
26% to 50%


Level III
High impact
51% to 75%


Level IV
Very high impact
76% to 100%






3. Instructions
The AIA is available  as an online  questionnaire on the Open Government Portal.  When the questionnaire is completed, the results provide an impact level and a  link to the requirements under the directive. The detailed results page will  also explain why the system was rated at a certain level. The results and the  explanation can be printed or saved as a PDF.
  The AIA assesses  automated decisions on a broad range of topics, including service recipients,  business processes, data, and system design decisions. It is best to complete  the AIA with a multi-disciplinary team that brings expertise in all of these  areas.
  Each question in the  AIA should be answered so that the impact  score can be accurate. If the answer to a question is unknown, select the  lowest score option for the question. Where applicable, be prepared to provide  the documentary evidence upon request.
Section 6 of the directive provides a comprehensive list of the requirements that  departments are responsible for. Some of the requirements increase for higher-impact  levels, including the type of peer review and the extent of human involvement  in the decisions. For a complete list of requirements that vary with the impact  level, refer to the appendix Impact Level  Requirements in the  directive. Other requirements are baseline requirements that do not vary  according to the impact level, such as consulting with the institution’s legal  services unit prior to the development of the system, testing and monitoring  outcomes, and providing applicable recourse options to  challenge the decisions.

3.1 When to complete the AIA
The AIA should be  completed at the beginning of the design phase of a project. The results of the  AIA will guide the mitigation and consultation requirements to be met during  the implementation of the automated decision system as set out in the  directive.
The AIA should be  completed a second time, prior to the production of the system, to validate  that the results accurately reflect the system that was built. The revised AIA  should be published on the Open Government Portal as the final results.

Reviewing and updating the AIA 
The AIA should be  reviewed, approved and updated on a scheduled basis, and when the functionality  or scope of the system changes (subsection 6.1.3). The schedule of review can  be aligned with and informed by the monitoring requirements (subsection 6.3.2)  and the reporting requirements (subsections 6.5.1 and 6.5.2). 
 Risks in automated  decision-making are difficult to fully anticipate during the development of a  system. Regular reviews throughout the system’s lifecycle will ensure that the AIA  remains up to date and the system remains effective.
The chosen frequency  of review can depend on a variety of factors, including the nature of the  system, the context of its deployment and the decision for which it is used. 
For example, the AIA  may be reviewed and updated more often when:

the service volumes are high
the system affects a large number of clients
the environment the system operates in evolves or changes rapidly
the impact level of the system is a Level 3 or 4




3.2 What to consider when completing an AIA

Collect information about your project 
A broad range of  information about an automation project is required to fully answer the  questions in the risk and mitigation areas of the AIA. Prior to starting the  AIA, it is useful to have information about:

the  administrative decision that the automated decision system will inform,  contribute to or make, the context in which the system will be used, and the  way the system will assist or replace the judgment of a human decision maker
the clients who are subject to the decision, including their demographics, needs or barriers they may encounter 
the potential impacts of the decision on clients, including their duration and  reversibility, and how the potential impacts are identified, assessed and  mitigated
the algorithm, including data processing parameters and techniques, and the output
the input data used by the system, including details on type, source, method of  collection and security classification
planned or existing quality assurance measures
planned transparency measures to communicate information about the initiative to  clients and the public
consultation approach with federal colleagues, clients or interest groups that represent  clients or other partners 
record of recommendations or decisions made by the system, and any log or explanation  generated by the system for such a record
information about how your institution manages and delivers information technology services  and solutions 



Consult your ATIP office
The institutional  Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) office or other delegated authority  for privacy should be consulted to ensure that the privacy impacts of automated  decision systems using or processing personal information, or that otherwise have  an impact on individuals’ privacy rights, are identified, assessed and  mitigated. Engagements can enable project leads to:

determine  whether the automated decision system will make use of personal information as  defined in section 3 of the Privacy Act
verify  whether the proposed system’s use of personal information is accounted for in  relevant Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) and Personal Information Banks (PIBs),  and identify actions and approvals required under privacy legislation and  policy
determine  applicable requirements in the Policy  on Privacy Protection and supporting policy  instruments, with the goal of ensuring that the appropriate safeguards are in  place for the creation, collection and handling of personal information  throughout the life cycle of the system, including plans for responsive action  in the event of a privacy breach
inform  approaches to notifying the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada of the proposed system and any foreseeable impacts on the privacy of  Canadians, as required in the Policy on  Privacy Protection
ensure  that any personal information collected or created by or for the automation  project is demonstrably necessary for the program or activity, as required by  the Directive  on Privacy Practices
ensure  that appropriate privacy protection clauses are included in contracts,  agreements or arrangements with vendors or partners providing automation  services, solutions or products
ensure that  the AIA is reviewed by privacy officials prior to its publication on the Open  Government Portal, in accordance with the Directive  on Open Government



Engage with legal services
The legal services unit  must be consulted to identify and address legal risks arising from the  development, procurement or use of an automated decision system. Consultations  should begin at the concept stage of an automation project, prior to the  development or procurement of a system. The nature of legal risks significantly  depends on the design of the system (for example, the training data and model),  the context of deployment, and the type of administrative decision being  automated. Seeking legal advice on an automated decision system can enable  project leads to:

comply  with the directive’s requirement to consult with the legal services unit from  the concept stage of a project (see subsection 6.3.12)
identify  potential impacts on individual rights and freedoms and develop plans to manage  risks
assess  risks to procedural fairness based on factors, including but not limited to the  explainability of system outputs, relevance of system rules and input data to  an administrative decision, and availability of recourse options 
confirm  whether the program has the requisite authorities to proceed with the proposed  automation project, including any associated collection or creation of personal  information (in coordination with the relevant ATIP office or other delegated  authority for privacy)
consider  licensing issues, including with respect to trade secrets, and any constraints  they may impose on a department’s ability to access and test proprietary  systems (see subsection 6.2.6 of the directive)



Engage Gender-based Analysis Plus experts
Engage with the  institution’s diversity and inclusion specialists while completing the AIA. They  can assist with impacts and mitigation measures related to diversity, inclusion,  bias and intersectionality. They can also assist in completing the Gender-based  Analysis Plus analysis as required under subsection 6.3.8. 


Contact TBS’s Office of the Chief Information Officer
The Office of the  Chief Information Officer (OCIO) of TBS is responsible for maintaining the AIA  tool and overseeing departmental compliance with the Directive on Automated Decision-Making. The team can support  departments with interpreting and answering questions in the AIA and guide them  through the publication process.
Departments are  encouraged to contact TBS OCIO at ai-ia@tbs-sct.gc.ca for  any questions regarding the directive or AIA.



3.3 Publishing the AIA 
Departments are  responsible for publishing the final results of the AIA in an accessible format  and in both official languages on the Open Government Portal (subsection 6.1.1).  The results page of the AIA provides the option to provide translations for the  text entered in the AIA. The results page also provides the option to download  the results as an accessible PDF to meet this requirement. Contact your  department’s Open Government team for assistance in publishing to the Open  Government Portal.
