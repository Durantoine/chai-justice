      Our approach
  



 

UNICEF Innocenti works for and with children and young people to seek solutions to their most pressing challenges. As we focus on the rights and lives of children and young people, we always ask: Who else can we include? Will this work cause unintended harm? Are there events that could surprise us? Does this work drive change?
